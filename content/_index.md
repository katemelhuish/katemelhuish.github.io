        I am a **mathematics education professor at Texas State University** with extensive methodological expertise across multiple domains of STEM education research.  

        My work includes **instrument design** (validity argument approaches and modern test theory), **evaluation of interventions and professional development** (hierarchical linear modeling, sensitivity analysis, generalized linear models, and fidelity of implementation), **design-based research** (in proof-related courses), and **computational approaches** such as **classification models**, **cluster analyses**, and **natural language processing**.  

        I emphasize methodological rigor, interpretive insight, and meaningful application to teaching and learning in undergraduate mathematics and STEM education contexts.

      text: |-
        **Principles**
        - **Utilization-focused**: decision-ready findings for PIs & teams  
        - **Formative + summative**: rapid feedback and no-surprise annual/final reports  
        - **Mixed methods**: surveys, observations, interviews, artifacts, admin data  
        - **Equity-conscious**: participation, experience, and opportunity-to-learn  
        - **Transparent & collaborative**: shared work plans and open communication  

        **Core capabilities**
        - Logic models & measurable outcomes  
        - Fidelity / implementation metrics tailored to interventions  
        - Instrument development & validation (CTT/IRT, psychometrics, argument-based validity)  
        - Survey & interview protocols; integrated qualitative + quantitative analysis  
        - Annual and final evaluation reports aligned to **NSF/IES** expectations  

        I currently serve as the external evaluator on an **NSF-CORE** project.

      text: |-
        I collaborate on and evaluate a range of grant-funded projects focused on improving undergraduate mathematics education, teacher preparation, and STEM pathways.  

        **Examples include:**
        - **NSF CORE Project:** External evaluator supporting research on proof and reasoning in STEM classrooms  
        - **NSF RUME and EHR projects:** Development of frameworks for quantitative reasoning and proof language  
        - **Instrument validation initiatives:** Synthesis of validation methodologies across mathematics education  
        - **Professional development efficacy studies:** Analysis using hierarchical models and sensitivity methods  

        I welcome collaborations on new proposals and formative evaluation partnerships.
