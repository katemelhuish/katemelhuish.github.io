        I am a **mathematics education professor at Texas State University**.  
        I work at the intersection of **measurement**, **instrument validation**, and **advanced quantitative methods**—supporting projects with right-sized, credible **external evaluation**.

        **Expertise:** validity/modern test theory; HLM/GLM for intervention efficacy; fidelity of implementation; design-based research in proof courses; and computational methods (classification, clustering, NLP).
