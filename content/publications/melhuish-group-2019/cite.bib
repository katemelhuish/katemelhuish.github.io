 abstract = {Introductory group theory provides the foundational course on algebraic structures. Yet, we know little about students' underlying conceptual understandings. In this paper, I introduce the Group Theory Concept Assessment (GTCA), a measure created for the purpose of conducting large-scale studies of student conceptual understanding in group theory. The GTCA measures this understanding divorced from proof construction ability. I outline the design process and share results from various stages of analysis and refinement. I then present an item-level analysis of the GTCA including a detailed look at four items. These items focus on subgroups, inverses, quotient groups, and kernels, respectively. I conclude by reflecting on the GTCA's potential usage as a research tool and practitioner tool.},
