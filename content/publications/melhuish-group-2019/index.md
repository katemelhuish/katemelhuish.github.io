abstract: Introductory group theory provides the foundational course on algebraic
  structures. Yet, we know little about students' underlying conceptual understandings.
  In this paper, I introduce the Group Theory Concept Assessment (GTCA), a measure
  created for the purpose of conducting large-scale studies of student conceptual
  understanding in group theory. The GTCA measures this understanding divorced from
  proof construction ability. I outline the design process and share results from
  various stages of analysis and refinement. I then present an item-level analysis
  of the GTCA including a detailed look at four items. These items focus on subgroups,
  inverses, quotient groups, and kernels, respectively. I conclude by reflecting on
  the GTCA's potential usage as a research tool and practitioner tool.
