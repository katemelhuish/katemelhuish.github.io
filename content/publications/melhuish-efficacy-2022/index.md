abstract: This article contributes to the larger narrative around what makes a mathematics
  professional development (PD) successful and in what ways. We share a research-based
  PD model that was implemented in elementary schools in an urban school district
  for 3 years. The model uses a pseudo lesson study approach and emphasizes standards-based
  instruction. We found that teachers made gains in knowledge and instruction quality.
  However, whereas some students saw gains on standardized assessments, this was the
  case only for students who were not members of historically minoritized groups (Black/Latino),
  countering our assumptions that the PD would lead to equitable achievement results.
  We conclude with a discussion of how a colorblind approach to PD may account for
  the inequitable results.
