abstract: Highlights •Abstract Algebra students demonstrate a range of evoked function
  resources, representations, and examples.•Abstract Algebra students may or may not
  demonstrate a unified understanding of function and homomorphism.•Abstract Algebra
  students’ understanding of function can support or constrain their activity related
  to homomorphism.
