abstract: 'Binary operations are one of the fundamental structures underlying our
  number and algebraic systems. Yet, researchers have often left their role implicit
  as they model student understanding of abstract structures. In this paper, we directly
  analyze students'' perceptions of the general binary operation via a two-phase study
  consisting of task-based surveys and interviews. We document what attributes of
  binary operation group theory students perceive as critical and what types of metaphors
  students use to convey these attributes. We found that many students treat superficial
  features as critical (such as element-operator-element formatting) and do not always
  perceive critical features as essential (such as the binary attribute). Further,
  these attributes were communicated across three metaphor categories: arithmetic-related,
  function-related, and organization-related.'
