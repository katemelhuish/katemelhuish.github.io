abstract: Counterstories can serve an important role in disrupting stereotypes in mathematics. In this study, we examine a set of diverse narratives crafted by eight mathematicians to share with undergraduate students. We found these narratives provided alternatives to the dominant storyline that mathematicians' career paths are linear and stem from an uninterrupted interest and success in mathematics. By presenting different ways of engaging with mathematics and entering the professoriate, these stories further disrupt dominant narratives of individualism, innate ability, and dehumanized mathematics. The stories emphasized joy in community and collaboration, renegotiating mathematical identity when encountering struggles, and bridging school and home life. These stories contribute to our understanding of basic narrative arcs and the ways mathematicians present their stories to inspire students.
