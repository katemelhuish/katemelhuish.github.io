abstract: 'Our field has generally reached a consensus that active-learning approaches
  improve student success; however, there is a need to explore the ways that particular
  instructional approaches affect various student groups. We examined the relationship
  between gender and student learning outcomes in one context: inquiry-oriented abstract
  algebra. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we analyzed content assessment data
  from 522 students. We detected a gender performance difference (with men outperforming
  women) in the inquiry-oriented classes that was not present in other classes. We
  take the differential result between men and women to be evidence of gender inequity
  in our context. In response to these findings, we present avenues for future research
  on the gendered experiences of students in such classes.'
