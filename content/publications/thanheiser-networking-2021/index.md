abstract: In this paper, we network five frameworks (cognitive demand, lesson cohesion,
  cognitive engagement, collective argumentation, and student contribution) for an
  analytic approach that allows us to present a more holistic picture of classrooms
  which engage students in justifying. We network these frameworks around the edges
  of the instructional triangle as a means to coordinate them to illustrate the observable
  relationships among teacher, students(s), and content. We illustrate the potential
  of integrating these frameworks via analysis of two lessons that, while sharing
  surface level similarities, are profoundly different when considering the complexities
  of a classroom focused on justifying. We found that this integrated comparison across
  all dimensions (rather than focusing on just one or two) was a useful way to compare
  lessons with respect to a classroom culture that is characterized by students engaging
  in justifying.
