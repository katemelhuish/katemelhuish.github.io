abstract: 'The concept of inverse is threaded throughout K-16 mathematics. Scholars
  frequently advocate for students to understand the underlying structure: combining
  an element and its inverse through the binary operations yields the relevant identity
  element. This ‘coordinated’ way of reasoning is challenging for students to employ;
  however, little is known about how students might reason en route to developing
  it. In this study, we analyze a teaching experiment with two beginning abstract
  algebra students through the lens of three ways of reasoning about inverse: inverse
  as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as a coordination of
  the binary operation, identity, and set. In particular, we examine the implications
  of these ways of reasoning as students work to develop inverse as a coordination.
  We identify pedagogical tools and facets of instructional design that appeared to
  support students’ development of inverse as a coordination. We further suggest that
  all three ways'
