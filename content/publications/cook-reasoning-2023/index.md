abstract: "The concept of inverse is threaded throughout K-16 mathematics. Scholars\
  \ frequently advocate for students to understand the underlying structure: combining\
  \ an element and its inverse through the binary operations yields the relevant identity\
  \ element. This \u2018coordinated\u2019 way of reasoning is challenging for students\
  \ to employ; however, little is known about how students might reason en route to\
  \ developing it. In this study, we analyze a teaching experiment with two beginning\
  \ abstract algebra students through the lens of three ways of reasoning about inverse:\
  \ inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as a coordination\
  \ of the binary operation, identity, and set. In particular, we examine the implications\
  \ of these ways of reasoning as students work to develop inverse as a coordination.\
  \ We identify pedagogical tools and facets of instructional design that appeared\
  \ to support students\u2019 development of inverse as a coordination. We further\
  \ suggest that all three ways"
