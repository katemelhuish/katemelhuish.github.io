 abstract = {The concept of inverse is threaded throughout K-16 mathematics. Scholars frequently advocate for students to understand the underlying structure: combining an element and its inverse through the binary operations yields the relevant identity element. This ‘coordinated’ way of reasoning is challenging for students to employ; however, little is known about how students might reason en route to developing it. In this study, we analyze a teaching experiment with two beginning abstract algebra students through the lens of three ways of reasoning about inverse: inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as a coordination of the binary operation, identity, and set. In particular, we examine the implications of these ways of reasoning as students work to develop inverse as a coordination. We identify pedagogical tools and facets of instructional design that appeared to support students’ development of inverse as a coordination. We further suggest that all three ways},
