abstract: "In many advanced mathematics courses, comprehending theorems and proofs
  is an essential activity for both students and mathematicians. Such activity requires
  readers to draw on relevant meanings for the concepts involved; however, the ways
  that concept meaning may shape comprehension activity is currently undertheorized.
  In this paper, we share a study of student activity as they work to comprehend the
  First Isomorphism Theorem and its proof. We analyze, using an onto-semiotic lens,
  the ways that students' meanings for quotient group both support and constrain their
  comprehension activity. Furthermore, we suggest that the relationship between understanding
  concepts and proof comprehension can be reflexive: understanding of concepts not
  only influences comprehension activity, but engaging with theorems and proofs can
  serve to support students in generating more sophisticated understanding of the
  concepts involved."
