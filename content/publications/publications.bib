The literature base on inverses is substantial, yet context-specific and compartmentalized. That is, extant research examines students’ reasoning with inverses within specific algebraic contexts. It is currently unclear what might be involved in productively reasoning with inverses across algebraic contexts, and whether the specific ways of reasoning from the literature can be abstracted to more general ways of reasoning about inverse. To address this issue, we conducted a standalone literature review to explicate and exemplify three cross-context ways of reasoning that, we hypothesize, can support students’ productive engagement with inverses in a variety of algebraic contexts: inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as a coordination of the binary operation, identity, and set.

However, we identified a need to better operationalize “authentic” and characterize student activity in relationship to the discipline in the undergraduate proof setting. We introduce the Authentic Mathematical Proof Activity (AMPA) framework as a theoretical tool for researchers interested in taking a multi-dimensional approach to documenting authenticity in students' proof-related activity. The framework provides both a means to deconstruct activity systems in terms of tools and objectives of the professional mathematician community and a set of dimensions (agency, authority, alignment, complexity, variety, and accuracy) to account for differing elements of authenticity related to both student and disciplinary aims.},

We network these frameworks around the edges of the instructional triangle as a means to coordinate them to illustrate the observable relationships among teacher, students(s), and content. We illustrate the potential of integrating these frameworks via analysis of two lessons that, while sharing surface level similarities, are profoundly different when considering the complexities of a classroom focused on justifying. We found that this integrated comparison across all dimensions (rather than focusing on just one or two) was a useful way to compare lessons with respect to a classroom culture that is characterized by students engaging in justifying.},

For each type of instruction, we focus on three categories of findings from the literature: description of instruction, instructor beliefs and rationales, and the relationship between instruction and students (cognitive, participatory, affective, and equity oriented). Much is known about the enactment of lecture-based teaching, including instructors’ cognitive and affective goals. The student-centered literature focuses on tensions and challenges implementing curricula with a greater focus on participatory goals. Overall, there are few studies that attempt to link instruc},

In applying a framework we developed to characterize the teachers' noticing in terms of mathematical content and reasoning form, we found that teachers rarely attended to justifying and generalizing in a manner consistent with the mathematics education community's view and that their lenses for noticing these activities may account for discrepancies between the teachers' reports and the researchers' observations.

We document what attributes of binary operation group theory students perceive as critical and what types of metaphors students use to convey these attributes. We found that many students treat superficial features as critical (such as element-operator-element formatting) and do not always perceive critical features as essential (such as the binary attribute). Further, these attributes were communicated across three metaphor categories: arithmetic-related, function-related, and organization-related.},

This observation from practice raises researchable questions: How common is this phenomenon? What is the nature of this phenomenon and can we explain why students produce this type of argument? In this paper, we report a small-scale two-part survey study and a preliminary interview study designed to begin exploring these questions. Our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely quite common and goes beyond a simple omission of a proof detail. Drawing on the research literature and our follow-up interviews, we propose potential explanations for this phenomenon. Finally, we discuss two different ways to think about supporting students},

Data analyzed include 1 round of open-ended surveys, 2 rounds of closed-form surveys, and 30 follow-up interviews.

The domain analysis phase included using an expert consensus protocol to arrive at the topics to be assessed, analyzing curriculum, and reviewing literature. From this analysis, items were created, evaluated, and field-tested. First, 383 students answered open-ended versions of the question set. The questions were converted to multiple-choice format from these responses and disseminated to an additional 476 students over two rounds.
