abstract: Many educators advocate for students to engage in authentic mathematical
  activity – activity reflective of the discipline. In our respective design studies,
  we had a common goal of engaging students in authentic mathematical activity in
  relation to proof. However, we identified a need to better operationalize “authentic”
  and characterize student activity in relationship to the discipline in the undergraduate
  proof setting. We introduce the Authentic Mathematical Proof Activity (AMPA) framework
  as a theoretical tool for researchers interested in taking a multi-dimensional approach
  to documenting authenticity in students' proof-related activity. The framework provides
  both a means to deconstruct activity systems in terms of tools and objectives of
  the professional mathematician community and a set of dimensions (agency, authority,
  alignment, complexity, variety, and accuracy) to account for differing elements
  of authenticity related to both student and disciplinary aims.
