abstract: "Many educators advocate for students to engage in authentic mathematical\
  \ activity \u2013 activity reflective of the discipline. In our respective design\
  \ studies, we had a common goal of engaging students in authentic mathematical activity\
  \ in relation to proof. However, we identified a need to better operationalize \u201C\
  authentic\u201D and characterize student activity in relationship to the discipline\
  \ in the undergraduate proof setting. We introduce the Authentic Mathematical Proof\
  \ Activity (AMPA) framework as a theoretical tool for researchers interested in\
  \ taking a multi-dimensional approach to documenting authenticity in students' proof-related\
  \ activity. The framework provides both a means to deconstruct activity systems\
  \ in terms of tools and objectives of the professional mathematician community and\
  \ a set of dimensions (agency, authority, alignment, complexity, variety, and accuracy)\
  \ to account for differing elements of authenticity related to both student and\
  \ disciplinary aims."
