We contribute methodological guidance on one qualitative synthesis approach, meta-aggregation, by sharing experiences and lessons learned from using this approach in mathematics education. We discuss how and why researchers can normalize the use of this synthesis approach to influence policies and practices in mathematics teaching and learning. By sharing our experiences and insights on meta-aggregation components, we aim to support and motivate future development and application of qualitative synthesis in mathematics education research.

		"abstract": "We conduct a critical review to explore how research on mathematics classroom assessment has positioned students (127 studies, 2015-2020). Our analysis shows how research has positioned students as passive recipients of assessment by portraying assessment through discourses of measurement and cognition. Conversely, students are positioned as active agents in their own learning through discourses of empowerment and monitoring. Finally, a discourse of performativity portrays classroom assessment as a way to promote results in large-scale assessments. These five discourses summarize how research produces knowledge about mathematics assessment and, in doing so, positions students as social agents with certain roles and responsibilities. Our review challenges assessment research communities to rethink how students are positioned in mathematics assessment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We assessed the efficacy of two spatial learning programs grounded in early years learning pedagogical theory to improve numeracy performance in preschool. Engagement with a play-based spatial program led to better overall spatial reasoning and transferred to better numeracy compared with a business-as-usual control, underscoring the importance of embedding spatial learning within strong pedagogy and authentic preschool contexts. Engagement with the same spatial program using a spatialized curriculum (e.g., gesture, sketching) showed large additive effects, highlighting the role of spatial reasoning tools to support transfer of spatial reasoning to numeracy. The effects of the two interventions were moderated by spatial reasoning, with children with lower spatial reasoning making the most gains in numeracy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Considerable research has been conducted on the critical role of gesture and action in children's mathematical thinking. However, teacher professional development (PD) has not tended to include specific supports for attending to nonverbal student thinking. In this Brief Report, we argue for including supports for multimodal teacher noticing in teacher PD. We illustrate how a targeted intervention can relatively quickly support teachers in learning to notice multimodal student thinking and demonstrate how shifting teachers' attention to gesture can enrich how they interpret the details of students' thinking.

		"abstract": "We present the evolving fraction conceptions of two elementary school children with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD). We use qualitative analyses to capture the mathematical knowledge and experiences of each child and show how teaching was used to support advancement of their fractional reasoning. Results illustrate two viable pathways of advancing fractional thinking, both of which reflect students' increasing levels of units coordination over time. We argue that recognizing and building on each child's strengths--while respecting and accommodating for their MLD--was central to promoting their learning. Results provide an existence proof of a new evidence base for student-centered, problem-based instruction for students with MLD, grounded in a careful understanding of student mathematical thinking and accommodations for cognitive differences.

We report findings from a study in which we identified patterns in the ways preservice elementary school teachers relied on working memory to coordinate mental actions when operating in fraction multiplication settings. UTGs account for the constraint of working memory in sequencing mental actions to solve mathematical tasks. They also explain the power of units coordinating structures in offloading demands on working memory. At the end of the article, we consider some of the research implications for these findings--specifically, ways that UTGs can lend explanatory and illustrative power to analyses of students' mathematics.

To understand the types of obstacles that can arise for students in these classrooms, we analyze data using two frameworks: mathematics identity and dimensions of mathematics classrooms. Study participants faced obstacles in three categories: (a) impressions of faculty’s instructional practices for problem solving; (b) negative race-related perceptions they believed classmates had about them; and (c) perceptions about instructors’ expectations. These findings contribute to literature on Black students’ progress in mathematics by identifying obstacles experienced by students who achieve in these courses and can also inform professional development learning for mathematics faculty.

		"abstract": "Emergent graphical shape thinking (EGST) involves interpreting or constructing a graph as dynamically generated, which is useful across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Although evidence suggests that students as young as middle school can engage in EGST with support, other research indicates most college students and U.S. teachers do not spontaneously engage in such reasoning when potentially productive. We describe a local instruction theory (LIT) to support middle school students developing EGST as part of their graphing meanings. We then present a case study to show how two students engaged with a task sequence designed with the LIT in mind to develop meanings for EGST. This article illustrates general principles researchers and educators could use to promote students’ graphing meanings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We hypothesized that difficulties with and misuse of terms or logic in conjectures are rooted in the early exploration stages of inquiry. We developed a generic activity format for if-then propositions and implemented the activity on a platform that collects and analyzes students' work. Finally, we searched for ways to use variation theory to analyze ninth-grade students' recorded work. We scored and classified data and found correlation between patterns in exploration stages and the conjectures students generated.

Meaningful features were generated from the process data to infer whether students spontaneously used calculators for mathematical problem solving, how frequently and when they used them, and the nature of the operations performed on calculators. Sequential pattern mining was applied on sequences of calculator keystrokes to obtain patterns of operations that were representative of students' problem-solving strategies or processes. Results indicated that higher scoring students not only were more likely to use calculators, but also used them in a more goal-driven manner than lower scoring students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This article introduces a unique tool, drawing from commognitive theory, for describing classroom discussions. The Realization Tree Assessment tool provides an image of a classroom discussion, depicting the realizations of the mathematical object manifested during the discussion and the narratives that articulate the links between these realizations. We applied the tool to 34 classroom discussions about a growing-pattern algebraic task and, through cluster analysis, found three types of whole-class discussion. Associations with classroom-level variables (track, but not grade level or teacher seniority) were also found. Implications with respect to applications and usefulness of the tool are discussed.

Two treatment groups received the intervention during the prekindergarten year, and one of these groups received follow-through support in kindergarten and first grade. Business-as-usual curricula were used in all other cases, including all years for the control group. Early effects on mathematics achievement decreased through fourth grade but reemerged at fifth grade. These results support both a latent trait hypothesis, whereby stable characteristics of students explain differences in achievement, and a latent foundation hypothesis, whereby early mathematical knowledge and skills provide a foundation for competence in mathematics in later years, especially those that involve challenging mathematics.

		"abstract": "This article shows that enabling teachers to integrate comparing solution strategies into their teaching fosters student flexibility in algebra. We designed two professional development (PD) programs that either focused exclusively on comparing solution strategies, or additionally introduced the accountable talk approach to guiding productive classroom discussions. The effects of both PD programs were investigated in an experimental field study (N = 39 teachers, 739 students). In both experimental groups, student posttest gains in strategy flexibility and procedural knowledge were greater than in the control group. The accountable talk group also increased conceptual knowledge. Significant effects in strategy flexibility were still observed 2.5 months later. We discuss recommendations for PD programs to foster flexibility in algebra using comparing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We compared the performance of U.S. first graders in the Common Core era with that of previous generations in solving 11 types of additive word problems to investigate a decades-long debate--whether certain types of word problems are inherently more difficult than others or whether relative difficulty is influenced by exposure. We found that overall patterns of relative difficulty persist; however, U.S. first graders in the Common Core era outperformed their historical counterparts when solving the types of problems that rarely appeared in textbooks used in the 1980s.

		"abstract": "This study examined the prevalence of teacher tracking in a population of 1,822 mathematics teachers in 184 high schools in a single state. Results showed that 70% of teachers were tracked by course level, course track, or both. Three fourths of high schools tracked at least 58% of their mathematics teachers. We also found significant differences in teaching assignments across quintiles of years of experience at a teacher's current school. First-quintile teachers were the most likely to be assigned low-track or entry-level courses. In contrast, fifth-quintile teachers were the most likely to be assigned high-track or upper-level courses. These findings indicate that the tracking of mathematics teachers is a prevalent and persistent inequitable structure in most high schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

As futurity becomes more popular in mainstream venues, it raises questions about how it will affect mathematics education (research). This Commentary makes an argument for desire-based research frameworks and Indigenous futurity praxis as key components of a spiritual turn, somewhat distinct from the sociopolitical turn our field took about a decade ago. I analyze some of the equity issues that arose in the March 2022 issue of JRME, raise three important questions to consider in our research, and offer suggestions so that we may embrace a spiritual turn.

We introduce the concepts of identity work and racialized emotions to provide an alternative reading of the articles in that issue, arguing that attention to the interplay of these two concepts is vital to consider issues of equity because mathematics identity intersects with race, gender, class, and sexuality, among other social identities historically marginalized in the classroom.

Edmunds's career as a student and then teacher of mathematics, which stretched from the antebellum era through Reconstruction and into segregation, was filled with obstacles and indignities but also with improbable successes. Edmunds proved to be among the world's top mathematical talents in 1871 by passing the grueling admissions exam for France's École Polytechnique. The purpose of the present article is to examine the implications that this historically rare example of Black mathematical achievement in the 19th century has for metanarratives of Black obstacles and achievement in mathematics education.

We share a research-based PD model that was implemented in elementary schools in an urban school district for 3 years. The model uses a pseudo lesson study approach and emphasizes standards-based instruction. We found that teachers made gains in knowledge and instruction quality. However, whereas some students saw gains on standardized assessments, this was the case only for students who were not members of historically minoritized groups (Black/Latino), countering our assumptions that the PD would lead to equitable achievement results. We conclude with a discussion of how a colorblind approach to PD may account for the inequitable results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This cluster-randomized controlled trial (N = 589) investigates differential effects for these extended target groups, comparing two language-responsive interventions (with or without vocabulary work) and a control group. The regression analysis reveals that all students significantly deepened their conceptual understanding in both interventions. Unlike what was anticipated, multilingual students' growth of conceptual understanding had no significant additional benefit from integrated vocabulary work. These findings call for promoting language-responsive mathematics instruction for all students and for using a discursive rather than a vocabulary focus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

In two studies, participants completed tasks assessing their specialized content knowledge (SCK) for teaching 12 mathematical topics addressed to varying degrees in the preparation program. We found that instructional time was positively associated with SCK demonstrated both immediately postgraduation and 2 years later. Several possible confounding factors were assessed; one, entering PSTs' average SCK for topics, appeared to influence the relationship. Accounting for professional learning postgraduation, such as attending professional development, did not change the underlying relationship. Considering these findings, we identify policy implications for the mathematics curriculum of PST education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We then propose a set of elements--identified by a group of mathematics education researchers, instrument developers, and psychometricians--to be included in the IUS. We describe the development process, the recommended elements for inclusion, and two example IUSs.

Through a secondary analysis of classroom videos, we linked these performance inequities to differences in women's participation rates across classes. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that simply implementing active learning is insufficient, and that the nature of inquiry-oriented classrooms is highly consequential for improving gender equity in mathematics.

		"abstract": "This article addresses why instructors choose to not use inquiry-oriented instructional practices (IO-IPs) even if they believe the practices are beneficial. A national sample of undergraduate mathematics instructors (N = 269) responded to questionnaires on their use of IO-IPs, beliefs on student learning, and recognition of professional obligations--their responsibilities toward various stakeholders including the individual student, mathematics as a discipline, the institution, and society (Herbst & Chazan, 2012). Structural equation modeling indicates that learner-focused beliefs often predict the use of IO-IPs, but that recognition of some professional obligations can work in opposition to those beliefs. Future work advocating for instructional change could use this framework to provide instructors with resources that leverage their existing priorities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Teacher evaluation policies have been central to policy efforts to enhance teaching quality. At the same time, ambitious mathematics instruction has been emphasized by teacher education programs as well as by the Common Core State Standards. Drawing on observation and survey data from early-career teachers, this study examines how teachers' perceived pressure of teacher evaluation policies shape their ambitious mathematics instruction. We found that teachers who perceived a strong pressure of teacher evaluation on their instructional practices tended to move further away from enacting ambitious mathematics instruction. Moreover, the negative association between the pressure of teacher evaluation and ambitious instruction was stronger for teachers with a high level of mathematical knowledge for teaching.

		"abstract": "This article presents a philosophical and pragmatic critique of critical mathematics (CM) and current vocational mathematics (VM) in the United States. I argue that, despite differences, CM and VM advocates share the view that the inauthentic contextualization of secondary mathematics does particular harm to students from historically marginalized groups and that the subject therefore should be recontextualized to address their lived experiences and apparent futures. Drawing on sociological theory, I argue that, in being responsive to so-called authentic real-world concerns, CM and VM fail to be responsive to the self-referential principles and specialized discourses necessary for future study of mathematics and, as such, may further disempower the very students that CM and VM advocates seek to empower.

This article extends previous conceptualizations of SJM, which typically encompass dual goals of teaching dominant and critical mathematics, by theorizing a third set of goals--affective pedagogical goals. Dominant, critical, and affective pedagogical goals are described within a framework of Three Dimensions of SJM. Two illustrative cases, one in a Title I public middle school and the other in an elite independent school, are presented to explore how affective pedagogical goals may be mediated by context. Affordances and tensions of affective pedagogical goals are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We introduce a framework for multidimensional noticing for equity that captures the stretch and expanse of teachers' attention and sense making of the local, sociocultural, and historical aspects of mathematics classrooms. We use data from two teachers' classrooms to illuminate how their noticing of students' sociocultural selves, of the history of mathematics and schooling, and of students' potential futures informs enactment of culturally sustaining instructional practice. We discuss this framework in relation to calls in mathematics education to create more equitable and affirming classroom spaces for youth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Precalculus and calculus are considered gatekeeper courses because of their academic challenge and status as requirements for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and non-STEM majors alike. Despite college mathematics often being seen as a neutral space, the field has identified ways that expectations, interactions, and instruction are racialized and gendered. This article uses the concept of labor to examine responses from 20 students from historically marginalized groups to events identified as discouraging in precalculus and calculus instruction. Findings illustrate how Black students, Latina/o students, and white women engage in emotional and cognitive labor in response to discouraging events. Additionally, to manage this labor, students named coping strategies that involved moderating their participation to avoid or minimize the racialized and gendered impact of undergraduate mathematics instruction.

However, few empirical studies have examined how mathematicians use proofs to obtain conviction and certainty. We report on a study in which 16 advanced mathematics doctoral students were given a task-based interview in which they were presented with various sources of evidence in support of a specific mathematical claim and were asked how convinced they were that the claim was true after reviewing this evidence. In particular, we explore why our participants retained doubts about our claim after reading its proof and how they used empirical evidence to reduce those doubts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Using the Mathematically Responsive Interaction (MRI) Framework and data from 11 middle-grades classrooms, we illustrate varied enactments of responsiveness and describe fluctuations in and relationships among different components of responsiveness. We found positive associations between different components of responsiveness, but they were not entirely predictive of one another. Individual classrooms appeared more or less responsive depending on which component was foregrounded. Our findings offer a more comprehensive characterization of responsiveness that documents the intertwined nature of teacher moves and student contributions during all whole-class instruction.

Invoking the anthropological meaning of practice, we claim that mathematical aesthetic practices shape meanings of and appreciation (or distaste) for particular manifestations of mathematics. To see learners' spontaneous mathematical aesthetic practices, we situate our study in an informal context featuring design-centered play with mathematical objects. Drawing from video data that support inferences about children's perspectives, we use interaction analysis to examine one child's mathematical aesthetic practices, highlighting the emergence of aesthetic problems whose resolution required engagement in mathematics sense making. As mathematics educators seek to broaden access, our empirical findings challenge commonsense understandings about what and where mathematics is, opening possibilities for designs for learning.

We found three key reading behaviors that describe how novices' reading differed from that of their experienced peers: alternative task models, accrual of premises, and warranting. Alternative task models refer to the types of goals that students set up for their reading of the text, which may differ from identifying and justifying inferences. Accrual of premises refers to the way novice readers did not distinguish propositions in the theorem statement as assumptions or conclusions and thus did not use them differently for interpreting the proof. Finally, we observed variation in the type and quality of warrants, which we categorized as illustrate with examples, construct a miniproof, or state the warrant in general form.

Using a mathematics discourse framework (Sfard, 2008), we analyzed how students interpreted precise (e.g., 2:30) and relative (e.g., half past 11) times, finding that particular words are dynamically interwoven with activity. Interviews with students in Grades 2 and 4 revealed that different prompts led to different narrative descriptions about time on the clock, with precise times leading to whole-number descriptions and relative times to part-whole descriptions consistent with fractions. Subsequent analysis of assessment performance for students across Grades 2-5 corroborated that specific time prompts led to particular clock interpretations. Implications for theory and the K-12 treatment of time measure are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this commentary is to acknowledge, illutilillatc, and counter the noticeable silences in the investigations of mathematics education researchers who conduct equity research with Black communities and other marginalized groups. For far too long, these communities have experienced a lengthy and complicated history of structural barriers; epistemological, symbolic, and intellectual violence; dehumanization; and antiblackness in mathematics education research. We advance the Critical-Historical (CritHistory) framework, which is rooted in critical race theory (CRT) and further explicates CRT's tenet of challenging ahistoricism. We discuss methodologies and implications, including example questions that could be posed, types and locations of archives that could be examined, and populations with whom oral histories could be conducted.

		"abstract": "In this article, we use a two-dimensional assessment to examine the experimental impacts of a mathematics learning trajectory-oriented formative assessment program on student strategies for problems involving multiplication and division. Working from the theory that the development of students' multiplicative reasoning involves improvements in both problem-solving accuracy and sophistication of strategies used to solve problems, we designed an assessment instrument to measure both dimensions of student learning. The instrument was used to measure the impact of the Ongoing Assessment Project (OGAP), which develops teachers' capacity to regularly assess student thinking in relation to a learning progression to develop instructional responses that are based on evidence of student thinking. The results showed significant impacts of OGAP on both students' problem-solving accuracy and the sophistication of their strategy. The findings suggest that capturing both dimensions of students' multiplicative reasoning offers important information for researchers and program designers who seek to understand different dimensions of student mathematics performance.

Participants included 1,455 Grade 6 students who had taken part in a cluster randomized trial in Grades 3-5. The results show that, as was the case at the end of Grades 3,4, and 5, treatment students significantly outperformed control students at the end of Grade 6 on a written assessment of algebraic understanding. However, treatment students experienced a significant decline and control students a significant increase in performance relative to their respective performance at the end of Grade 5.

		"abstract": "We use a narrative framework to investigate how mathematics textbook lessons can promote sustained student inquiry. Our analysis of four high school textbook lessons on the SSA congruence property, three of which contain explorations, reveals how explorations can promote problem-solving perseverance by inspiring readers to raise mathematical questions and by keeping these questions open throughout significant portions of the lesson. Furthermore, student curiosity and anticipation can be enhanced through ambiguity. Stark structural differences exist among lessons with explorations, suggesting that explorations are not necessarily supportive of sustained student inquiry. These insights not only enable educators to learn whether and how a lesson encourages inquiry but also support the design of new curricular materials aligned with the goals of reform.

		"abstract": "Coaching is a popular, yet costly, professional development structure. Therefore, understanding the learning opportunities coaching provides is essential. Following a framework by Campbell and Griffin (2017), we explore five elementary school teachers' learning opportunities during 15 meetings and 23 lessons with two instructional coaches in two schools. Using Greeno's (2005) situative perspective, we focus on coach-teacher dyads, examining the substance and depth (Coburn, 2003) of their conversations. Results indicate that most coach-teacher talk centered on logistics, whereas mathematics conversations were rare. We consider institutional contexts that shaped the dyads' discussions, ultimately viewing the coaches and teachers as \"sensible beings\" (Leatham, 2006) with valid reasons for focusing discussions as they did. Coaching implications and directions for research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

(2009) defined the normative identity of mathematics classrooms as the obligations that students must meet to be considered good-at-math. Obligations are negotiated between teachers and students through series ofbids. Normative identities reveal distributions of agency and authority within classrooms, which affect learning opportunities for students. Traditionally, mathematics teachers held the predominance of agency and authority in classrooms. Research supports shifting toward more equitable teaching and learning (e.g., National Council ofTeachers of Mathematics, 2018). Clear examples of enacting and supporting changes are helpful. This article shares how sixthgrade students and their teacher co-constructed good-at-math to invite and obligate students to become active agents in mathematical argumentation.

Differences in teachers' support for collective argumentation have been observed and documented, and the importance of the teacher's role in supporting collective argumentation is well established. This article seeks to explain differences in teachers' support for argumentation by examining two student teachers' beliefs about mathematics, teaching, and proof to see which beliefs are visible in their support for argumentation. Assisted by a framework for argumentation and a commitment to teachers' beliefs and actions as sensible systems, we found that teachers' beliefs about the role of the teacher, particularly with respect to giving explanations, were more visible in their support for collective argumentation than other beliefs about mathematics or proof.

The framework guided a counter-storytelling analysis that captured variation in Black women's experiences of within-group tensions-a function of internalized racial-gendered ideologies and normalized structural inequities in mathematics education. Findings revealed variation in Black women's resilience through coping strategies for managing such within-group tensions. This analysis advances equity-oriented efforts beyond increasing Black women's representation and retenti6n by challenging the racializedgendered culture of mathematics. Implications for educational practice and research include ways to disrupt P-16 mathematics education as a white, patriarchal space and broaden within-group solidarity, including Sisterhood among Black women.

		"abstract": "Despite progress toward gender equity, troubling disparities in mathematical probtem-solving performance and related outcomes persist. To investigate why, we build on recurrent findings in previous studies to introduce a new construct, \"bold problem solving,\" which involves approaching mathematics problems in inventive ways. We introduce a self-report survey of bold problem-solving orientation and find that it mediates gender differences in problem-solving performance for both high-achieving middle school students (n = 79) and a more diverse sample of high school students (n = 222). Confidence mediates the relation between gender and bold problem-solving orientation, with mixed results for mental rotation skills and teacher-pleasing tendencies as mediators. Overall, the new bold problem-solving construct appears promising for advancing our understanding of gender differences in mathematics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Recent international studies have found that teachers' attitudes, biased against historically marginalized groups, predict lower student achievement in mathematics (e.g., van den Bergh et al., 2010). It is not clear, however, if or how teachers' racial attitudes affect their evaluation of students' mathematical thinking to produce these effects. Using an experimental design, we conducted an online survey to examine the relationship between preservice teachers' (PSTs) racial attitudes and their perceptions of students' mathematical thinking. The survey used comparable videos, with similar mathematics content and student thinking, one including Black students and the other, White students. Findings show that PSTs evaluated Black students' thinking less favorably compared with White students. Explicit, but not implicit, attitudes, as well as reported time spent in African American communities, were factors in how PSTs rated the quality of students' mathematical thinking by race.

		"abstract": "Current reforms in geometry seek to challenge prevailing ideas about \"what it means to do mathematics\" (Stephan et al., 2015, p. 139) by engaging learners in \"the grasping of space\" (Freudenthal, 1973; Hansen et al., 1998, p. 241). This study takes up this challenge by investigating problematizing activity as an embodied phenomenon among 21 eighth-grade learners who engaged with spatial and dimensional concepts during a series of investigations around Flatland. Using a phenomenological research approach, we examined classroom discourse as well as learners' blog postings, lived-experience descriptions, and interviews. The analysis revealed three manifestations of problematizing activity--provocation, impasse, and questioning and conjecturing activity. Embodiment was evidenced through perceptuo-motor-imaginary activity as learners juxtaposed naturally continuous space with discrete notions of space emphasized in K-12 settings.

		"abstract": "A theoretical model describing young students' (Grades 1-3) functional-thinking modes was formulated and validated empirically (n = 345), hypothesizing that young students' functional-thinking modes consist of recursive patterning, covariational thinking, correspondence-particular, and correspondence-general factors. Data analysis suggested that functional-thinking tasks can be categorized on the basis of the proposed model. Analysis traced three categories of students that represent different functional-thinking profiles. Category 1 students exhibited a recursive-thinking profile. Category 2 students utilized a combination of recursive and contextual strategies and exhibited an emergent covariational and correspondence-particular thinking. Category 3 students approached functional-thinking situations flexibly, using a combination of covariational and correspondence strategies. A structural model showed two parallel paths from recursive patterning to correspondence-general through correspondence-particular or covariational. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We hypothesize that teachers use different SMK-G in different aspects of their teaching work and that such differences can be scaled and associated with key elements of instruction. Analyses of 602 high school teachers' responses to two sets of items designed to measure the SMK-G used in two particular tasks of teaching--understanding students' work (USW) and choosing givens for a problem (CGP)--suggested the two scales of SMK-G to be distinguishable and differently related to experience in teaching high school geometry.

The study develops a framework in which procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge are connected to limited and rich qualities of GoGARs. General characteristics of limited GoGARs are their atomistic, implicit, and noninferential nature, as opposed to rich GoGARs, which are holistic, explicit, and inferential. The mathematical discussions of a Grade 6 class serve the case to show how the framework of procedural and conceptual GoGARs can be used to give an account of qualitative differences in procedural and conceptual knowledge in the teaching of mathematics.

As I reflected on the research we published during those 4 years, I wondered what perceptions might be conveyed about the state of mathematics education research. I considered relationships among broader social and political events or issues and the studies that were published. I also tried to discern any shifts that might distinguish this research from what had been published previously. From my musings, I identified three themes that characterize the nature of the research published during my editorship and highlight the aspects of the research that might not be apparent when reading an individual article or perusing a particular issue of the journal.

We investigate the impact of this manuscript on the field. To do this, we conducted a literature review (n = 59) of journal articles and proceedings published since 1998 covering the same population and goals of Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold (changing prospective teachers' beliefs) and then conducted an analysis of 101 journal articles citing Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold (1998) to see why the authors cited the piece. We conclude that the impact of Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold's article differs from that of their results and suggest that belief structures should be more carefully investigated by the field.

We examined the relationship between gender and student learning outcomes in one context: inquiry-oriented abstract algebra. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we analyzed content assessment data from 522 students. We detected a gender performance difference (with men outperforming women) in the inquiry-oriented classes that was not present in other classes. We take the differential result between men and women to be evidence of gender inequity in our context. In response to these findings, we present avenues for future research on the gendered experiences of students in such classes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

A qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with the teachers established three typologies of care: empathetic, transactional, and blended. A questionnaire measure of mathematics classroom connectedness revealed that students in classrooms led by teachers who enacted an empathetic caring pedagogy were more likely to agree that their teachers provided emotional support, their classroom felt like a family, and their contributions were valued in class. Furthermore, students' sense of classroom connectedness mediated the link between teacher care and the students' perceived value and relevance of mathematics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

As mentioned in my first editorial (Heid, 2009a), it takes the entire community to continue the production of a top-tier journal, and that necessity guided our thinking from the start. At Penn State, two senior researchers, Glendon Blume and Rose Mary Zbiek,1 agreed to take on the positions of Associate Editors, and we worked together to maintain the integrity and quality of what was (and is) arguably one of the most highly regarded mathematics education research journals (Nivens & Otten, 2017; Toerner & Arzarello, 2012; Williams & Leatham, 2017). As we worked on the journal, we initiated practices and structures designed to maintain and solidify JRME's leading role among top-tier journals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We investigated the extent to which one elementary school child with working-memory differences made sense of number as a composite unit and advanced her reasoning. Through ongoing and retrospective analysis of eight teaching-experiment sessions, we uncovered four shifts in the child's real-time negotiation of number over time: (a) initial \"2s\" and symmetry to consider counting on, (b) participatory awareness of 10 and use of algorithmic knowledge, (c) break apart and growing anticipation of tacit counting, and (d) advanced participatory tacit double counting. The results suggest a possible link between the child's participatory knowledge and the extent to which her enacted activity met her goals for solving the problem more than her current \"knowing.\" The implications regarding a possible proof of concept toward implicit, intensive instruction are shared.

		"abstract": "Research has demonstrated that textbooks exert a considerable influence on students' learning opportunities and that technology has the potential to transform mathematics instruction. This brief report provides a systematic analysis of how technology tasks are integrated into secondary mathematics curricula by analyzing a sample of 20 textbooks. The results indicate that across the entire sample, nearly 15% of tasks incorporated technology, and of those, 21% used it as a reorganizer of students' mathematical thinking; calculators were the predominant technology utilized. Investigative textbooks were not more likely to incorporate technology than conventional texts, but algebra 2 texts were more likely to include technology than geometry texts. Implications for instruction and teacher preparation are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Early education is replete with debates about \"academic\" versus \"play\" approaches. We evaluated 2 interventions, the Building Blocks (BB) mathematics curriculum and the BB synthesized with scaffolding of play to promote executive function (BBSEF), compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) control using a 3-armed cluster randomized trial with more than 1,000 children in 84 preschool classrooms across three districts (multiracial or multiethnic, low income, 27% English Language Learner). Impact estimates for BBSEF were mixed in sign, small in magnitude, and insignificant. Most impact estimates for BB were positive, but only a few were statistically significant, with more in the kindergarten year (delayed effects), including both mathematics achievement and executive function (EF) competencies. Gains in both mathematics and EF can be mutually supportive and thus resist the fade-out effect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Counting is fundamental to early mathematics. Most studies of teaching counting focus on teachers observing children count. The present study compares mathematical ideas that 12 PK, transitional kindergarten (TIC), and kindergarten teachers noticed from observing their own students count during a classroom session of Counting Collections with ideas that they noticed outside class time in the same students' representations of counting on paper. Inviting teacher noticing in representations (a) drew attention to distinct conceptions that children required to represent counting; (b) increased the number of mathematical ideas that participants perceived in students' thinking; and (c) helped participants perceive different levels in, and their own uncertainties about, students' understanding. This study suggests that teacher noticing in children's representations of counting can deepen teachers' understanding of students' mathematical thinking. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

However, teachers' instructional practices do not always neatly align with their beliefs because of factors perceived as constraints. The purpose of this article is to introduce a new approach for examining the relationship between teachers' beliefs and practices, an approach that focuses on specific instructional practices that support the development of students' conceptual understanding and on mismatches that occur between what teachers believe to be important and what they report actually doing in the classroom. We also examine the relationship between teachers' self-reported constraints and mismatches between teachers' beliefs and practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Research focused on learning mathematics in a 2nd language is generally located in individual 2nd-language contexts. In this ethnographic study, I investigated mathematics learning in 4 different second-language contexts: a mainstream classroom, a sheltered classroom for Indigenous students, a welcome class for new immigrants, and a French-immersion classroom. The study was framed by a view of learning as socialization and the Bakhtinian notion of centripetal and centrifugal language forces. I present 7 socialization events that were particularly salient in 1 or more of the classrooms. For each socialization event, I identify various socialization practices. Based on a comparison of socialization practices in the 4 classrooms, I propose a distinction between language positive and language neutral mathematics classrooms. In language positive mathematics classrooms, students' socialization into mathematics and language includes explicit attention to different aspects of language use in mathematics. In language neutral mathematics classrooms, the role of language in mathematics tends to be implicit. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Textbooks are a standard component of undergraduate mathematics courses, but research shows that students often do not view textbooks as productive resources to support learning. This article seeks to understand the factors affecting how individuals engage in reading a calculus textbook excerpt and what they leam from reading. To better understand the separate roles of background knowledge and other reading practices, we compare 2 readers: a 2nd-semester calculus student and a nonmathematics STEM professor. We employ the concepts of sense making and the implied reader to analyze each reader's experience and a disciplinary literacy perspective to explain the similarities and differences we find between the 2 readers. We propose the concept of didactical disciplinary literacy--an adaptation of disciplinary literacy applied to didactical texts--to describe the ways that the professor drew on his identity as a teacher to shape his reading practices.

		"abstract": "Productive struggle--expending effort to make sense of something beyond one's current level of understanding--aids in learning mathematics concepts and procedures. In this study, we surveyed 197 parents with children in the 1st to the 5th grade on their beliefs about productive struggle. Beliefs were assessed via questionnaire and rating of a recorded lesson involving productive struggle. Parents also reported how often they helped with math homework and their child's ability in math. The results show that parents had diverse beliefs about the efficacy of productive struggle, with fathers favoring it more than mothers. A significant relation was found between parents' beliefs about productive struggle and reports of their child's ability in math. The findings of this study suggest that for productive struggle to be effective, parents must intentionally facilitate experiences through student-centered approaches. Programs for parents should emphasize specific evidence-based behaviors rather than broad generalizations about increased involvement with homework. Schools and educators should also provide guidance for parents to explain the potential harmful effects of gender stereotypes and parents' own math anxiety and to teach methods for limiting homework interaction while students grapple with difficult problems.

		"abstract": "Students' attitudes toward mathematics and the strength of their mathematics preparation typically go hand in hand such that their specific effects are difficult to disentangle. Employing the method of propensity weighting of a continuous variable, we built hierarchical linear models in which mathematics attitudes and preparation are uncorrelated. Data used came from a national survey of U.S. college students taking introductory calculus (N = 5,676). A 1-standard-deviation increase in mathematics preparation predicted a 4.72-point higher college calculus grade, whereas a 1-standard-deviation increase in mathematics attitudes resulted in a 3.15-point gain. Thus, the effect of mathematics preparation was about 1.5 times that of mathematics attitudes. The two variables did not interact, nor was there any interaction between gender and these variables.

		"abstract": "Normative discourse about probability requires shared meanings for disciplinary vocabulary. Previous research indicates that students' meanings for probability vocabulary often differ from those of mathematicians, creating a need to attend to developing students' use of language. Current standards documents conflict in their recommendations about how this should occur. In the present study, we conducted microgenetic research to examine the vocabulary use of four students before, during, and after lessons from a cycle of design-based research attending to probability vocabulary. In characterizing students' normative and nonnormative uses of language, we draw implications for the design of curriculum, standards, and further research. Specifically, we illustrate the importance of attending to incrementality, multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity to foster students' probability vocabulary development.

		"abstract": "In this article, we argue that although mathematics educators are concerned about social issues, minimal attention has been paid to student-student interactions outside the classroom. We discuss social network analysis as a methodology for studying such interactions in the context of an undergraduate course. We present results on the questions: Who studies with whom? What are students' study habits, and are these systematically related to the habits of those with whom they interact? Do individual and collaborative study habits predict attainment? We discuss the implications of these findings for research on undergraduate learning and on social issues in mathematics education, suggesting that social network analysis may provide a bridge between mathematics education researchers who focus on cognitive and on social issues.

		"abstract": "To design and improve instruction in mathematical proof, mathematics educators require an adequate definition of proof that is faithful to mathematical practice and relevant to pedagogical situations. In both mathematics education and the philosophy of mathematics, mathematical proof is typically defined as a type of justification that satisfies a collection of necessary and sufficient conditions. We argue that defining the proof category in this way renders the definition incapable of accurately capturing how category membership is determined. We propose an alternative account--proof as a cluster category--and demonstrate its potential for addressing many of the intractable challenges inherent in previous accounts. We will also show that adopting the cluster account has utility for how proof is researched and taught. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We compared students' learning gains in authentic seventh-grade classrooms (N = 144) in 4 different interventions that incorporated a computer game that aims to teach players to solve linear equations. Significantly higher learning gains were measured in the implementations that were specifically designed to mediate the attribution of algebraic meaning to objects, actions, and rules in the game by engaging students in analogical mapping between these constructs and their algebraic counterparts and an exploration of the boundaries of this isomorphism. These findings suggest that learning disciplinary content and skills from a digital game requires learners to attribute disciplinary meaning to objects, actions, and rules in the game. Moreover, this process does not necessarily occur spontaneously and benefits from instructional mediation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We considered how this varies by the racial composition of the school; further, we examined differences in access between both Black and Hispanic students and their White peers as well as differences between Black and Hispanic students. The results point to patterns of reproduction of inequality in racially integrated schools, with some evidence of increasing inequality in predominantly Hispanic schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The difficulty of 12 normatively oriented cube-related sketches was theoretically ranked according to their ratios, #PHI/#PMI. The ranking was compared to the actual visual difficulty as measured by the percentage of correct or desired comprehension, individual spatial ability, and study-time allocation. This procedure was repeated for unnormatively oriented sketches, obtained by vertically flipping the original sketches. In both cases, the findings substantiate #PHI/#PMI as an a priori measure of visual difficulty. Practical, theoretical, and methodological implications are inspected and discussed.

In this commentary, we respond to this proposed framework and aim to clarify some key elements. Furthermore, we draw on our own positionings and scholarly interests to critique and bolster the framework by focusing on the tensions related to co-opting the Common Core for equity-oriented purposes, the framework's relationship to neoliberalism, and the role of racialized rhetoric and nondominant family and community knowledge.

		"abstract": "Past experiences as mathematics learners play a critical role in the way mathematics teachers consider what it means to know, do, and teach mathematics. Thus, understanding past experiences and ways to work with them in teacher education is a critical concern. Using phenomenological inquiry, we investigated moments of shift that occur along one's mathematics journey. The study draws on 30 prospective teachers' experiences in the form of lived-experience writing and interview data. Findings show that prospective teachers' shifts manifest in relations with others, across different time frames, and through material relations with mathematics. Most salient was the tentative and mutable nature of shifts, showing that shift might be better viewed as a possibility rather than a single event. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Principles from sociopolitical perspectives and Critical Race Theory, and historical analyses of deficit thinking in education research, support the investigation into the system. Using existing research about students' understanding of a limit in calculus as context, this article proposes a definition of a deficit perspective on sense making and unpacks some of its tenets. The data illustration in this article focuses on the mathematical sense making of a Chicana undergraduate student. The analysis uses an anti-deficit perspective to construct a sensemaking counter-story by a woman of color. The counter-story challenges existing deficit master-narratives about the mathematical ability of women of color. The article closes with a proposal for an anti-deficit method for studying the sense making of students of color. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The stories of high-achieving African American mathematics students are gaining prominence in the research literature. In this multiple case study, I use a critical race theoretical frame to document and analyze the experiences of 4 mathematically persistent African American male students who earned undergraduate degrees in mathematics and subsequently enrolled in mathematics or mathematics education graduate programs. The findings reveal that these African American men drew from internal factors to influence their mathematical persistence and identified how racial microaggressions manifest themselves in postundergraduate contexts. Recommendations for practice, policy implications, and future research directions that emerged from this study are discussed to better understand African American men's mathematics experiences.

This article reports on a metasynthesis of 35 qualitative reports of social justice mathematics enactments in diverse classroom contexts. Critical race theory serves as a guiding framework for analyzing possibilities and limitations of these enactments to address racial inequities in mathematics education. Findings from this metasynthesis reveal that addressing race in social justice mathematics explorations provided opportunities for centering the voices of people of Color and critiquing liberal views that camouflage subtle forms of racism and involved substantial and authentic mathematical work. Promising practices and implications for future research are identified based on this synthesis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The multiplication principle (MP) is a fundamental aspect of combinatorial enumeration, serving as an effective tool for solving counting problems and underlying many key combinatorial formulas. In this study, we used guided reinvention to investigate 2 undergraduate students' reasoning about the MP, and we sought to answer the following research questions: How do students come to understand and make sense of the MP? Specifically, while a pair of students reinvented a statement of the MP, how did they attend to and reason about key mathematical features of the MP? The students participated in a paired 8-session teaching experiment during which they progressed from a nascent to a sophisticated statement of the MP. Two key mathematical features emerged for the students through this process, including independence and distinct composite outcomes, and we discuss ways in which these ideas informed the students' reinvention of the statement. In addition, we present potential implications and directions for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We report a novel survey that narrows the gap between information about teachers' knowledge of fraction arithmetic provided, on the one hand, by measures practical to administer at scale and, on the other, by close analysis of moment-to-moment cognition. In particular, the survey measured components that would support reasoning directly with measured quantities, not by executing computational algorithms, to solve problems. These components--each of which was grounded in past research--were attention to referent units, partitioning and iterating, appropriateness, and reversibility. A second part of the survey asked about teachers' professional preparation and history. We administered the survey to a national sample of in-service middle-grades mathematics teachers in the United States and received responses from 990 of those teachers. We analyzed responses to items in the first part of the survey using the log-linear diagnostic classification model to estimate each teacher's profile of strengths and weaknesses with respect to the four components of reasoning. We report on the diversity of profiles that we found and on relationships between those profiles and various aspects of teachers' professional preparation and history. Our results provide insight into teachers' knowledge resources for enacting standards-based instruction in fraction arithmetic and an example of new possibilities for mathematics education research afforded by recent advances in psychometric modeling.

		"abstract": "This study examined the genre of undergraduate mathematical proof writing by asking mathematicians and undergraduate students to read 7 partial proofs and identify and discuss uses of mathematical language that were out of the ordinary with respect to what they considered conventional mathematical proof writing. Three main themes emerged: First, mathematicians believed that mathematical language should obey the conventions of academic language, whereas students were either unaware of these conventions or unaware that these conventions applied to proof writing. Second, students did not fully understand the nuances involved in how mathematicians introduce objects in proofs. Third, mathematicians focused on the context of the proof to decide how formal a proof should be, whereas students did not seem to be aware of the importance of this factor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This Brief Report addresses the fundamental role that sign language plays in the mathematics classroom of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students. Selected findings are gathered from an ongoing study of signs and gestures used by DHH students and their teachers when encountering and communicating mathematical ideas at a German special-needs school that focuses on hearing and communication. The focus rests primarily on iconic aspects of mathematical ideas as reflected in the gestural-somatic modality of sign language. A categorization of iconicity in mathematical signs as used by the students is presented and used to reconstruct a case of meaning making in a Grade 5 geometry classroom. Insights gained from these observations lead beyond the DHH mathematics classroom by providing new perspectives on the interplay between language and communication, individual experience, and shared conceptualization.

		"abstract": "We respond to a call to analyze issues of curriculum standards and to present alternative storylines by addressing criticisms of the Common Core State Standards in early childhood. We describe a storyline from multiple media and evaluate this storyline's criticisms, focusing on the criticism that the standards are developmentally inappropriate. We review research and conclude that the criticism is invalid and may reflect a historical belief in the primacy of development over learning rather than the research record. Misinterpreting or ignoring relevant research has equity consequences because it may particularly harm those children most in need of learning support in learning grade-level mathematics. Fortunately, theory and research illuminate learning trajectories that help all children meet these standards. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Many research studies have sought to explain why NCTM's vision for mathematics classrooms has not had greater impact on everyday instruction, with teacher beliefs often identified as an explanatory variable. Using instructional exchanges as a theoretical construct, this study explores the influence of teachers' institutional positions on the solving of equations in algebra classrooms. The experimental design uses surveys with embedded rich-media representations of classroom interaction to surface how teachers appraise correct solutions to linear equations where some solutions follow suggested textbook procedures for solving linear equations and others do not. This paper illustrates the feasibility of studying teaching with rich-media surveys and suggests new ways to support changes in everyday mathematics teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We administered parallel tasks for 3 mathematics topics studied in the program and one mathematics topic not studied in the program. When significant differences were found, participants always performed better on mathematics topics developed in the program than on the topic not addressed in the program.

		"abstract": "In a cross-sectional study, 160 students in Grades 2, 4, 7, and 11 were interviewed about their reasoning when solving integer addition and subtraction opcn-number-sentence problems. We applied our previously developed framework for 5 Ways of Reasoning (WoRs) to our data set to describe patterns within and across participant groups. Our analysis of the WoRs also led to the identification of 3 problem types: change-positive, all-negatives, and counterintuitive. We found that problem type influenced student performance and tended to evoke a different way of reasoning. We showed dial those with more experience with negative numbers use WoRs more flexibly than those with less experience and that flexibility is correlated with accuracy. We provide 3 types of resources for educators: (a) WoRs and problem-types frameworks, (b) characterization of flexibility with integer addition and subtraction, and (c) development of a trajectory' of learning about integers.

		"abstract": "We examine the effects of 3 interventions designed to support Grades 2-5 children's growth in measuring rectangular regions in different ways. We employed the microgenetic method to observe and describe conceptual transitions and investigate how they may have been prompted by the interventions. We compared the interventions with respect to children's learning and then examined patterns in observable behaviors before and after transitions to more sophisticated levels of thinking according to a learning trajectory for area measurement. Our findings indicate that creating a complete record of the structure of the 2-dimensional array--by drawing organized rows and columns of equal-sized unit squares--best supported children in conceptualizing how units were built, organized, and coordinated, leading to improved performance.

		"abstract": "Building on the work of Professional Noticing of Children's Mathematical Thinking, we introduce the Curricular Noticing Framework to describe how teachers recognize opportunities within curriculum materials, understand their affordances and limitations, and use strategies to act on them. This framework builds on Remillard's (2005) notion of participation with curriculum materials, connects with and broadens existing research on the relationship between teachers and written curriculum, and highlights new areas for research. We argue that once mathematics educators better understand the strategic curricular practices that support ambitious teaching, which we refer to as professional curricular noticing, such knowledge could lead to recommendations for how to support the curricular work of teachers and novice teachers in particular.

We analyzed the full text of all articles published in Educational Studies in Mathematics and the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education since their foundation. Using Lakatos's (1978) notion of a research programme, we focus on the field's changing theoretical orientations and pay particular attention to the relative prominence of the experimental psvchology, constructivist, and sociocultural programmes. We quantitatively assess the extent of the \"social turn,\" observe that the field is currently experiencing a period of theoretical diversity, and identify and discuss the \"experimental cliff,\" a period during which experimental investigations migrated away from mathematics education journals.

CT offers a powerful epistemic frame that, by foregrounding core dispositions and practices useful in computer science, helps students understand mathematical concepts as outward oriented. The article conceptualizes the characteristics of CT dispositions through a review of relevant literature and examples from a study that explored secondary mathematics teachers' engagement with CT. Discussion of the CT framework highlights the complementary' relationship between CT and mathematical thinking, the relevance of mathematics to 21st-century professions, and the merit of CT to support learners in experiencing these connections.

I examined secondary' students' work on a problem involving modeling the periodic motion of a Ferris wheel through the use of a visual programming environment. Using the cK¢ model of conceptions, I characterized 5 conceptions of sine and cosine functions in students' work that differed in the ways that students interpreted tire given problem, their use of semiotic resources, and the control structures that motivated their work. This study illustrates the range of prior knowledge and resources that students may draw on in their use of trigonometric functions as well as how the goals of students' work inform their reasoning about trigonometric functions.

This study investigates how mathematics teaching practices might contribute to students' beliefs about mathematics ability being a fixed or malleable trait (mindset). Through a synthesis of existing literature and an analysis of data from classroom observations, this article presents a framework of teaching practices and identifies how varying implementations of these practices can be classified along a continuum from conveying fixed-mindset messages to conveying growth-mindset messages related to mathematics ability.

We used a data set of 6,207 students of 216 professors at 133 randomly selected U.S. colleges and universities, and hierarchical models controlled for differences in demography and background. Mastery of the mathematics considered preparatory for calculus was found to have more than double the impact of taking a high school calculus course on students' later performance in college calculus, on average. However, students with weaker mathematics preparation gained the most from taking high school calculus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We investigated how secondary mathematics teachers check student geometry proofs. From video records of geometry-teachers checking proofs, we conjectured that teachers have different expectations for details that follow from written statements than for details that are conveyed by diagrams. To test our conjectures, we randomly assigned 44 secondary mathematics teachers to 1 of 3 experiment groups (n = 13, n = 15, n = 16) in which they viewed and rated representations of instructional practice. Participants in each group viewed treatment or control versions of instructional scenarios and rated the appropriateness of the teachers' work in different segments of each scenario. We compared participants' ratings across and within experiment groups. We found that participants rated lower instruction that deviated from what we hypothesized to be their expectations, confirming our hypotheses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Through their work on the Fractions Project. Steffc and Olive (2010) identified a progression of fraction schemes that describes students' development toward more and more sophisticated ways of operating with fractions. Although several quantitative studies have affirmed this progression, tire question has remained open as to whether it is specific to the U.S. classrooms in which these studies were conducted or whether it describes a developmental progression that crosses international boundaries. The purpose of our replication study was to address that question using data gathered from written assessments of 76 5th- and 6th-grade students in China. Results indicate a remarkably similar progression among students in the United Stales and students in China. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Equity in mathematics classroom discourse is a pressing concern, but analyzing issues of equity using observational tools remains a challenge. In this article, we propose equity analytics as a quantitative approach to analyzing aspects of equity and inequity in classrooms. We introduce a classroom observation tool that focuses on relatively low-inference dimensions of classroom discourse, which are cross-tabulated with demographic markers (e.g.. gender, race) to identify' patterns of more and less equitable participation within and across lessons. We argue that equity analytics can support researchers and practitioners in identifying subtle patterns of inequity in classroom discourse. As we show, even in classrooms with highly experienced, equity - minded teachers, subtle inequities can emerge that arc detectable through this quantitative methodology. To conclude, we discuss how equity analytics can complement qualitative approaches in the study of equity and inequity in classrooms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Images of mathematics and mathematicians are often negative and stereotyped. These portrayals may work to construct our impressions of mathematics and influence students' identity with and future participation in the subject. This study examined young adult fiction as a context in which school mathematics is portrayed and constructed. I used positioning theory and tire notion of story lines to analyze a sample of 59 books. Portrayals of school mathematics within this sample involved multiple story lines, including school mathematics as being obligatory but not useful and mathematics classes as tense, terrible, difficult, and different but perhaps as places in which to find love. Portrayals of mathematics teachers were extremely stereotyped, and some girls were just as likely as boys to be positioned as able mathematics learners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Persistent disconnects within and among education research, practice, and policy are limiting the reach of professional mathematics teacher communities, one of the most promising levers for humanizing mathematics teaching and learning in schools, An overarching goal of this commentary is to convince the field of mathematics education to broaden our research agendas beyond individual classrooms to teacher collectives so that our combined efforts have a greater positive impact on how people experience mathematics in and out of school. The commentary begins with a focused review of extant literature on teacher community to establish context, clarify theoretical underpinnings, and describe three important problems of teacher community, The need for research on these problems is connected to tire need for studies of mathematics teacher learning to better specify what counts as evidence of learning and how this evidence gets analyzed. In response, and for the sake of epistemological and ontological transparency, teacher learning is theorized from a community-of-practice perspective. A frame analysis methodology for empirical analysis of collaborative mathematics teacher learning w ithin professional teacher community contexts is theorized, thereby contributing provisional tools for the field to use in this work.

		"abstract": "The current study uses a large, nationally representative data set and a new method for computing teacher expectations to better understand the developmental effect of mathematics teacher expectations on future student achievement. The study utilizes autoregressive cross-lagged models with 5 time points between kindergarten and 8th grade as well as multigroup modeling to examine group differences in teacher expectancy effects on achievement for girls and minority students. Results indicate that students\" experiences with teacher expectations from 1 time point to the next are not significantly associated with one another, but their association with future student achievement grows over time. Teacher expectancy effects in mathematics are stronger for White girls, minority girls, and minority boys than they are for White boys. Implications for teaching are discussed.

		"abstract": "Elementary prospective school teachers (PSTs) often struggle to understand why they need to relearn the mathematics that they think they already know. In this set of replication studies, I address this struggle in 3 ways: First, by increasing and varying the participant pool, I replicate Thanheiser s (2009) study, which shows that PSTs do not yet understand number in a way that enables them to teach it. Second, I introduce, validate, and examine the effect of using a survey instead of interviews, thus changing the methods of the original study. Third, I move beyond Thanheiser's original study' and show that an interview designed to help PSTs assess their own knowledge accurately correlates with more sophisticated conceptions at the end of the course. Based on these findings, I posit that such an interview could be used to help PSTs learn the mathematics that they need to teach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Many studies in mathematics education research occur with a nonrepresentative sample and are never replicated. To challenge this paradigm, I designed a large-scale study evaluating student conceptions in group theory that surveyed a national, representative sample of students. By replicating questions previously used to build theory aroimd student understanding of subgroups, cyclic groups, and isomorphism with over 800 students, I establish the utility of replication studies to (a) validate previous results, (b) establish the prevalence of various student conceptions, and (c) reexamine theoretical propositions. Data analyzed include 1 round of open-ended surveys, 2 rounds of closed-form surveys, and 30 follow-up interviews. I illustrate the potential of replication studies to refine theory and theoretical propositions in 3 ways: by offering alternate interpretations of student responses, by challenging previous pedagogical implications, and by reevaluating connections between theories.

As in our original commentary, we highlight concerns we have regarding the delivery of CAI programs and potential misuses of CAI, particularly at Title I schools that largely serve historically marginalized student groups. Specifically, we concentrate on how CAI may contribute to underserved students generally experiencing mathematics in impoverished ways that do not align with reforms being advocated by the mathematics education community. We also argue that Clements and Sarama appear to dismiss or ignore our central argument that some CAI programs are not designed or are not being used to support the development of students' mathematical reasoning and fluency.

		"abstract": "This article describes the development and validation of two forms of the Geometry Assessments for Secondary Teachers (GAST), which were designed to assess teachers\" knowledge for teaching geometry. Both forms were developed by teams of mathematicians, mathematics educators, psychometricians, and secondary' classroom geometry teachers. Predictive validity' for the GAST assessment was explored by observing and testing 157 teachers as well as administering pre- and post-tests to 3,698 students. The reliability coefficient for both GAST assessment forms was acceptable (r = .79). GAST assessment scores explained a statistically significant but small amount of the variance of student scores, demonstrating an effect that was greater than the number of years of teaching experience but smaller than the effect of having an advanced degree.

		"abstract": "In this article, I investigate the influence of the dominant culture characterizing mathematics education--which I term the culture of exclusion--on efforts to teach for equity. Analyzing a year of observations in an urban high school mathematics department, 1 found that this culture structured everyday instruction even for teachers who expressed strong commitment to equity and who participated in ongoing equity-oriented professional development. Through their classroom practice, the 4 focal teachers in this study often framed mathematics as a fixed body of knowledge to be received, and they positioned students as deficient, unintentionally excluding many students from rich learning opportunities. However, these teachers also asserted alternatives to the culture of exclusion, showing how resistance to this culture might take shape in everyday mathematics instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This study explores positive Mis (high achiever and positive relationship with mathematics) of 3 girls. We employed a nested model of identity based on a case study approach (i.e., female mathematics students nested within a cluster of students nested within a mathematics classroom). The results highlight diversity in how these girls experienced mathematics: They valued different forms of doing mathematics (independent and collaborative; wider and complex; and straightforward, procedure-oriented mathematics), showed different forms of engagement (detachment, protagonist and challenging, and compliant and support-seeker), and narrated different Mis (efficient, different, and responsible). The study also explores and discusses the roles of mathematical practice and belonging to different peer clusters in these different forms of identification. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Gender research in mathematics education has experienced methodological and theoretical shifts over the past 45 years. Although achievement studies have used assessment tools to explore and subsequently challenge the assumption of male superiority on mathematics assessments, research on participation has unpacked these studies' sex-based achievement comparisons by exploring the masculinization of mathematics through qualitative methods. This article offers a review of gender research in mathematics education w ith analysis of its findings as well as conceptual and empirical contributions. Current understanding of mathematics as a gendered space, however, can be further broadened through intersectional analyses of gender and its interplay with other identities (e.g., race or ethnicity, class). Implications for future gender research, particularly the adoption of intersectionality theory, are raised to inform more nuanced analyses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "In tills Brief Report, we share the main findings from our line of research into embodied cognition and proof activities. First, attending to students' gestures during proving activities can reveal aspects of mathematical thinking not apparent in their speech, and analyzing gestures after proof production can contribute significantly to our understanding of students' proving practices, particularly when attending to dynamic gestures depicting relationships that are difficult to communicate verbally. Second, directing students to produce physical actions before asking them to construct a mathematical proof has the potential to influence their subsequent reasoning in useful ways, as long as the directed actions have a relationship with the proof content that is clearly meaningful to the students. We discuss implications for assessment practices and teacher education, and we suggest directions for future research into embodied mathematical proof practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Past studies have documented students' and teachers' persistent difficulties in determining whether 2 quantities covary in a direct proportion, especially when presented missing-value word problems. In the current study, we combine a mathematical analysis with a psychological perspective to offer a new explanation for such difficulties. The mathematical analysis highlights numbers of equal-sized groups and places reasoning about proportional relationships in the context of reasoning about multiplicative relationships more generally. The psychological perspective is rooted in diSessa's (diSessa, 1993,2006; diSessa, Sherin, & Levin, 2016) know ledge-in-pieces epistemology and highlights diverse, fine-grained knowledge resources that can support inferring and reasoning with equal-sized groups. We illustr ate how the combination of mathematical analysis and psychological perspective may be applied to data using empirical examples drawn from interviews during which preservice middlegrades teachers reasoned with varying degrees of success about relationships presented in word problems that were and were not proportional.

		"abstract": "This study (n = 1,044) used data from the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) to examine the relationship between field experience focus (instruction- or exploration-focused), duration, and timing (early or not) and prospective elementary teachers' intertwined knowledge and beliefs about mathematics and mathematics learning. Early instruction-focused field experience (i.e., leading directly to classroom instruction) was positively related to the study outcomes in programs with such field experience of median or shorter duration. Moreover, the duration of instruction-focused field experience was positively related to study outcomes in programs without early instruction-focused field experience. By contrast, the duration of exploration-focused field experience (e.g., observation) was not related to the study outcomes. These findings suggest that field experience has important but largely overlooked relationships with prospective teachers' mathematical knowledge and beliefs. Implications for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "In a previous study of 2 schools in England that taught mathematics very differently, the first author found that a project-based mathematics approach resulted in higher achievement, greater understanding, and more appreciation of mathematics than a traditional approach. In this follow-up study, the first author contacted and interviewed a group of adults 8 years after they had left the 2 schools to investigate their knowledge use in life. This showed that the young adults who had experienced the 2 mathematics teaching approaches developed profoundly different relationships with mathematics knowledge that contributed towards the shaping of different identities as learners and users of mathematics (Boaler & Greeno, 2000). The adults from the project-based school had also moved into significantly more professional jobs, despite living in one of the lowest income areas of the country'. In this article, we consider the different opportunities that the 2 school approaches offered for long-term relationships with mathematics and different forms of mathematical expertise that are differentially useful in the 21st century' (Hatano & Oura, 2003).

We present 3 of her tasks from Weeks 1, 20, and 46 along with an overview of the complete 52 weeks. We compare the data from the tasks to Brousseau’s (1997) Theory of Didactical Situations of Mathematics to answer our research questions: Can robotics play support the devolution of a fundamental situation to an adidactic situation of mathematics for children who are critically ill? When children with critical illness engage in robotics play, what are the key features of the robotics phenomenon that support devolution to an adidactic situation? We found evidence of the robotics supporting the devolution of a fundamental situation to an adidactic situation of mathematics in each robotics task and evidence of 4 key features (thick authenticity, feedback enabling autonomy, connectivity, and competence) of robotics play that support this devolution.

		"abstract": "The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) do not make any promises about the teaching practices that should be used to support students’ enactment of the standards. Thus, equity gets framed as achievable through making the standards a goal for all students. We know from research on past reform efforts that standards without explicit (or companion) teaching practices, and teaching practices without explicit attention to equity, will inevitably result in the failure o f the standards to achieve goals for students. This commentary provides a framework for future research that hypothesizes research-based equitable mathematics teaching practices in support of the CCSSM's Standards for Mathematical Practice, connecting research, policy, and practice in order to realize the equity potential of the CCSSM.

		"abstract": "To learn mathematical practices, students need opportunities to engage in them. But simply providing such opportunities may not be sufficient to support all students. Simultaneously, explicitly teaching mathematical practices could be problematic if instruction becomes prescriptive. This study investigated how teachers might make mathematical practices explicit in classroom discourse. Analyses of 26 discussions from 3 mathematics classes revealed that teachers made mathematical practices explicit primarily after students had participated in them. I present a framew'ork of 8 types of teacher moves that made mathematical practices explicit and argue that they did so without turning practices into prescriptions or reducing students' opportunities to engage in them. This suggests a need to expand conceptions of explicitness to promote access to mathematical practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

It is based on a qualitative study of my untracked, 12th-grade mathematics class, a full-year enactment of mathematics for social and racial justice. Students were Black and Latin@ from a low-income, working-class community with a tradition of resistance. Any neighborhood student could enroll without selection criteria. The class goal was for students to cocreate a classroom in which they would learn and use collegepreparatory', conceptually based mathematics to study and understand social reality to prepare themselves to change it.

However, the link between a curriculum program and student learning is affected by the ways in which teachers use resources to design learning experiences. In the first half of this commentary, I raise questions about the emphasis in research on finding the most effective curriculum programs or the most effective teaching practices as separate from one another, and I claim that research should prioritize understanding the most effective ways in which a teacher can use available materials, including expanding the definition of \"effective.\" In the second half of this commentary, I suggest how researchers can build on existing work to define, describe, and support teachers in learning more effective practices for using curriculum in ways that bring together research on curriculum effectiveness and teaching effectiveness.

In this study, we examine 6 teaching assistants' teaching practices in the context of a geometry content course for preservice teachers by focusing on their enactment of reasoning-and-proving tasks. Results indicate that teaching assistants engaged preservice teachers in a variety of reasoning-and-proving activities. For 42 of 82 tasks observed, preservice teachers' engagement in reasoningand- proving processes decreased relative to the potential for reasoning and proving in mathematical tasks. This investigation into teaching assistants' teaching practices identifies factors associated with their enactment of reasoning-and-proving tasks (e.g., generating student participation). This research has implications for professional development to support college mathematics instructors' teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Although the number, type, and quality of qualitative research studies in mathematics education has changed, little is known about how a collective body of qualitative research findings contributes to our understanding of a particular topic within the field. Through a process of qualitative research metasynthesis, our knowledge base can be broadened to provide insights into attitudes, perceptions, interactions, structures, and behaviors relevant for mathematics teaching and learning. The purpose of this commentary is to provide a rationale, definition, and procedure to conduct qualitative metasynthesis as a means of synthesizing and interpreting qualitative studies in the field of mathematics education.

To examine how MLD has been identified and what mathematics topics have been explored, we conducted a systematic review of 164 studies on MLD published between 1974 and 2013. Findings indicate that (a) there was great variability in the classification methods used, (b) studies rarely reported demographic differences between the MLD and typically achieving groups, and (c) studies overwhelmingly focused on elementary-aged students engaged in basic arithmetic calculation. To move the field toward a more precise and shared definition of MLD, we argue for standards for methodology and reporting, and we identity- a need for research addressing more complex mathematics.

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to shed light on the mathematics-learning experiences of students who were enrolled in non-credit-bearing remedial mathematics courses at a 4-year university. Non-credit-bearing remedial mathematics courses have a long curricular history in both 2-year and 4-year higher education institutions, but students' mathematics-learning experiences in these courses have been largely unexplored. Furthermore, other recent studies have evinced the otherwise anecdotal supposition that African American learners, particularly, are disproportionately placed in these courses. In this study, students narratives are the primary unit of analysis, and the data are derived from semistructured interviews with then-enrolled students and observations in a noncrcdit- bearing remedial mathematics course at a public, 4-vear university. The study's findings center on two psychosocial phenomena amid these students' mathematicslearning experiences: identity satisficing and racialized identity threat. The article closes with implications for future research regarding both non-credit-bearing remedial mathematics courses and mathematics-learning identities and experiences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This study examines how collective activity related to multiplication evolved over several class sessions in an elementary mathematics content course that was designed tofoster prospective elementary teachers' number-sense development. We document how the class drew on as-if-shared ideas to make sense of multidigit multiplication in terms of partial products and to reason flexibly about products. We document how the class overcame the challenge of accounting for partial products in multidigit multiplication, including particular activities and ways of reasoning that facilitated progress. The results provide insights into how prospective elementary teachers' understanding of multidigit multiplication can develop during a content course and how a sequence of instructional activities and practices can productively leverage the resources that they bring in support of that development.

Participants included 247 Kindergartners from 37 classrooms in 9 schools located in low-income communities. Children within classrooms were randomly assigned to receive 21 weeks of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in mathematics with Building Blocks or in literacy with Earobics Step 1. Children in the Building Blocks condition evidenced higher posttest scores on tests of numeracy and Applied Problems after controlling for beginning-of-year numeracy scores and classroom nesting. These findings, together with a review of earlier CAI, provide guidance for future work on CAI aiming to improve mathematics performance of children from low-income backgrounds.

		"abstract": "As part of a dramatic recent shift in tertiary education, many undergraduate students now learn mathematics via fully online courses. At present, the mathematics education research community knows very little about this shift, and in this report, we consider implications of an investigation into the instructor experience of fully online undergraduate mathematics courses. To compare instructor experiences of fully online and face-to-face teaching, we explored assessment schemes, feedback processes, and approaches to teaching using a survey and semistructured interviews. The main emergent theme was instructor concern about the loss of short-cycle face-to-face human interaction. We argue that this concern is serious but should be seen as an opportunity for education researchers to leverage knowledge about effective mathematics teaching to simultaneously alleviate instructors' difficulties and promote and study pedagogical development.

		"abstract": "Recent reform movements have emphasized students making meaning of algebraic relationships; however, research on student thinking and learning often remains disconnected from the design of widely used curricular materials. Although a previous examination of algebra textbooks (Nathan, Long, & Alibali, 2002) demonstrated a preference for a symbols-first approach, research has demonstrated that Algebra I students' performance on verbally presented problems is better than on symbolic equations, consistent with cognitive theories suggesting the value of concreteness fading. The present study investigates whether current textbooks used in Algebra I courses demonstrate a formalisms-first approach using five different analyses. Results show that despite nearly 2 decades of research on student learning, the conventional textbooks used in most classrooms have been resistant to change and emphasize manipulation with symbols prior to making sense of verbal scenarios.

We report students' initial and changing expectations of the outcomes of tossing one and two coins, how they related the relative frequency from their physical and computer-simulated trials to the theoretical probability, and how they created and interpreted theoretical probability models. Findings include students' progression from an initial apparent equiprobability bias in predicting outcomes of tossing two coins through to representing the outcomes of increasing the number of trials. After observing the decreasing variation from the theoretical probability as the sample size increased, students developed a deeper understanding of the relationship between relative frequency of outcomes and theoretical probability as well as their respective associations with variation and expectation. Students' final models indicated increasing levels of probabilistic understanding. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

These students maintained high levels of academic achievement in these fields while enduring marginalization, stereotyping, and other forms of racialization. Their fragile mathematical identities were manifested in the way they were motivated to achieve in order to prove false the negative expectations of others. Their robust mathematical identities were characterized by an evolving sense of self-efficacy and discovery, a growing affinity and passion for mathematics, and a desire to be a mathematically inspiring role model. Extending the work on identity development, I recommend more nuanced interpretations of the interplay of human development, racialized experiences, and distinctly race-related risk and protective factors that complicate mathematical identity formation for Black college students in mathematics and engineering fields.

This article reports an empirically developed learning trajectory in first-grade children's (6-year-olds') thinking about generalizing functional relationships. We employed design research and analyzed data qualitatively to characterize the levels of sophistication in children's thinking about functional relationships. Findings suggest that children can learn to think in quite sophisticated and generalized ways about relationships in function data, thus challenging the typical curricular approach in the lower elementary grades in which children consider only variation in a single sequence of values.

		"abstract": "Our aim is to discuss how school mathematical activity is modified when students' everyday situations are brought into the classroom. One illustrative sequence--7th grade classes solving problems that required proportional reasoning--is characterized as a system of interconnected activities within the theoretical perspective of activity theory. We discuss the tensions and contradictions that evolve when a generic school procedure emphasized by the teacher meets the specific procedures applicable to everyday situations proposed by the students. We evaluate the modifications that we perceived in the power relationships and other components of the school activity and the expansion of the meaning of those procedures as positive outcomes of how everyday situations were dealt with in school mathematics.

		"abstract": "We examined the codevelopment of mathematical concepts and the mathematical practice of defining within a sixth-grade class investigating space and geometry. Drawing upon existing literature, we present a framework for describing forms of participation in defining, what we term aspects of definitional practice. Analysis of classroom interactions during 16 episodes spanning earlier and later phases of instruction illustrate how student participation in aspects of definitional practice influenced their emerging conceptions of the geometry of shape and form and how emerging conceptions of shape and form provided opportunities to develop and elaborate aspects of definitional practice. Several forms of teacher discourse appeared to support students' participation and students' increasing agency over time. These included: (a) requesting that members of the class participate in various aspects of practice, (b) asking questions that serve to expand the mathematical system, (c) modeling participation in aspects of practice, (d) proposing examples that create contest (i.e., monsters), and (e) explicitly stating expectations of and purposes for participating in the practice.

		"abstract": "Given the prominence of group work in mathematics education policy and curricular materials, it is important to understand how students make sense of mathematics during group work. We applied techniques from Systemic Functional Linguistics to examine how students positioned themselves during group work on a novel task in Algebra II classes. We examined the patterns of positioning that students demonstrated during group work and how students' positioning moves related to the ways they established the resources, operations, and product of a task. Students who frequently repositioned themselves created opportunities for mathematical reasoning by attending to the resources and operations necessary for completing the task. The findings of this study suggest how students' positioning and mathematical reasoning are intertwined and jointly support collaborative learning through work on novel tasks.

		"abstract": "The efficacy of a research-based number-sense intervention for low-achieving kindergartners was examined. Children (N=126) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: a number-sense intervention followed by a number-fact practice session, an identical number-sense intervention followed by a number-list practice session, or a business-as-usual control group. The interventions were delivered in a small-group setting over 24 half-hour lessons. Both intervention groups performed better than controls on measures of number sense, arithmetic fluency, and general mathematics calculation achievement at immediate posttest. However, the number-fact practice condition gave children an additional advantage over the number-list practice condition on the outcomes at delayed posttest 8 weeks later. The number-fact practice condition was especially effective for producing gains in English learners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Twenty-one K-8 teachers who were enrolled in a master's program were followed for 3 years to study how their mathematical knowledge and teaching changed over time. The results of multilevel growth models indicated that gains in teachers' mathematical knowledge predicted changes in the quality of their lesson design, their mathematical agenda, and the classroom climate.

This report extends prior studies of the reliability of the Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA), a widely used classroom observation toolkit, and offers insight into the often asked question: \"What is the number of observations required to reliably measure a teacher's instructional practice using the IQA?\" We found that in some situations, as few as three observations are needed to reliably measure a teacher's instructional practice using the IQA. However, that result depends on a variety of other factors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "To understand relationships between students' fractional knowledge and algebraic reasoning in the domain of equation writing, an interview study was conducted with 12 secondary school students, 6 students operating with each of 2 different multiplicative concepts. These concepts are based on how students coordinate composite units. Students participated in two 45-minute interviews and completed a written fractions assessment. Students operating with the second multiplicative concept had not constructed fractional numbers, but students operating with the third multiplicative concept had; students operating with the second multiplicative concept represented multiplicatively related unknowns in qualitatively different ways than students operating with the third multiplicative concept. A facilitative link is proposed between the construction of fractional numbers and how students represent multiplicatively related unknowns. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We examine the semiotic structure of these visual features in two parts. One, we conduct a semiotic inquiry to conceptualize geometry diagrams as mathematical texts that comprise choices from different semiotic systems. Two, we use the semiotic catalog that results from this inquiry to analyze 2,300 diagrams from 22 high school geometry textbooks in which the dates of publication span the 20th century. In the first part of the article, we identify axes along which the features of geometry diagrams can vary, and in the second part of the article, we show the viability of using the semiotic framework to conduct empirical studies of diagrams in geometry textbooks.

We conceptualize an important group of instances in classroom lessons that occur at the intersection of student thinking, significant mathematics, and pedagogical opportunities- what we call Mathematically Significant Pedagogical Opportunities to Build on Student Thinking. We analyze dialogue to illustrate a process for determining whether a classroom instance offers such an opportunity and to demonstrate the usefulness of the construct in examining classroom discourse. This construct contributes to research and professional development related to teachers' mathematically productive use of student thinking by providing a lens and generating a common language for recognizing and agreeing on a critical core of student mathematical thinking that researchers can attend to as they study classroom practice and that teachers can aspire to notice and build upon when it occurs in their classrooms.

Participants included 106 students; 39 received the early algebra intervention, and 67 received their district's regularly planned mathematics instruction. We share and discuss students' responses to a written pre- and post-assessment that addressed their understanding of several big ideas in the area of early algebra, including mathematical equivalence and equations, generalizing arithmetic, and functional thinking. We found that the intervention group significantly outperformed the nonintervention group and was more apt by posttest to use algebraic strategies to solve problems. Given the multitude of studies among adolescents documenting students' difficulties with algebra and the serious consequences of these difficulties, an important contribution of this research is the finding that-provided the appropriate instruction-children are capable of engaging successfully with a broad and diverse set of big algebraic ideas.

		"abstract": "In this article, we present a mathematical analysis that distinguishes two distinct quantitative perspectives on ratios and proportional relationships: variable number of fixed quantities and fixed numbers of variable parts. This parallels the distinction between measurement and partitive meanings for division and between two meanings for multiplication-one rooted in counting equal-sized groups, the other in scaling the size of the groups. We argue that (a) the distinction in perspectives is independent from other distinctions in the literature on proportional relationships, including the within measure space versus between measure space ratio distinction; (b) the psychological roots for multiplication suggest the accessibility of the two perspectives to learners; and (c) the fixed numbers of variable parts perspective, though largely overlooked in past research, may provide an important foundation for central topics that build on proportional relationships. We also suggest directions for future empirical research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This commentary emphasizes the importance of coordinating perspectives from statistics education and mathematics education through boundary interactions between the two communities of practice. I argue that such interactions are particularly vital in shared problem spaces related to the teaching and learning of measurement, variability, and contextualized problems. Collaborative work within these shared problem spaces can contribute to the vitality of each discipline. Neglect of the shared problem spaces may contribute to insularity and have negative consequences for research and school curricula. Challenges of working at the boundaries are considered, and strategies for overcoming the challenges are proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

I defined the enactment of cognitively demanding tasks to involve task selection and maintenance of the cognitive demand of high-level tasks and examined those two dimensions of enactment separately. I used multilevel logistic regression models to investigate how mathematical knowledge for teaching and conceptions of teaching and learning mathematics for 213 middle school mathematics teachers were related to their enactment of cognitively demanding tasks. I found that teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching and conceptions of teaching and learning mathematics were contingent on one another and significantly related to teachers' enactment of cognitively demanding tasks.

		"abstract": "The central goals of most introductory linear algebra courses are to develop students' proficiency with matrix techniques, to promote their understanding of key concepts, and to increase their ability to make connections between concepts. In this article, we present an innovative method using adjacency matrices to analyze students' interpretation of and connections between concepts. Three cases provide examples that illustrate the usefulness of this approach for comparing differences in the structure of the connections, as exhibited in what we refer to as dense, sparse, and hub adjacency matrices. We also make use of mathematical constructs from digraph theory, such as walks and being strongly connected, to indicate possible chains of connections and flexibility in making connections within and between concepts. We posit that this method is useful for characterizing student connections in other content areas and grade levels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "In many STEM-related fields, graduating doctoral students are often expected to assume a postdoctoral position as a prerequisite to a faculty position, yet there is no such expectation in mathematics education. This phenomenon is likely due in large part to an abundance of faculty positions; however, it may also result from the field's perspective on postdoctoral positions. In this commentary, we call on the mathematics education research community to consider the importance of postdoctoral fellows, and we make the case that prioritizing postdoctoral positions could afford mutual benefits to the postdocs, to faculty mentors, and to the field at large.

		"abstract": "Slow faculty uptake of research-based, student-centered teaching and learning approaches limits the advancement of U.S. undergraduate mathematics education. A study of inquiry-based learning (IBL) as implemented in over 100 course sections at 4 universities provides an example of such multicourse, multi-institution uptake. Despite variation in how IBL was implemented, student outcomes are improved in IBL courses relative to traditionally taught courses, as assessed by general measures that apply across course types. Particularly striking, the use of IBL eliminates a sizable gender gap that disfavors women students in lecture-based courses. The study suggests the real-world promise of broad uptake of student-centered teaching methods that improve learning outcomes and, ultimately, student retention in college mathematics.

		"abstract": "This study of early-career teachers identified a significant relationship between upper-elementary teachers' mathematical content knowledge and their students' mathematics achievement, after controlling for student- and teacher-level characteristics. Further, the mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge of middlegrades teachers were each directly and positively related to their students' mathematics achievement, with and without teacher-level controls. Significant interactions emerged between teachers' perceptions and knowledge influencing student achievement. Teachers' claimed awareness of their students' dispositions toward mathematics interacted with upper-elementary teachers' content knowledge; middlegrades teachers' beliefs regarding modeling mathematical solutions and organizing instruction to support incremental mastery of skills interacted with both content and pedagogical knowledge. Findings provide evidence of the relevance of teacher knowledge and perceptions for teacher preparation and professional development programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

However, the influence of this teaching element on students' interest-related motivational orientations is an open question. In this article, we report the results of an experimental study (N = 145) that was carried out to investigate the influence of prompting students to construct multiple solutions for real-world problems with vague conditions on students' interest in mathematics as well as on their experiences of competence and autonomy and the number of solutions developed. A positive effect of the intervention on students' interest was found using inferential and path analyses. The number of solutions developed by students and their experiences of competence and autonomy mediated the effects of prompting multiple solutions on interest. Implications for teaching practices and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We found that instructional tasks were drawn from multiple sources, including textbooks, tests, supplemental materials, and the teacher. Our analysis of cognitive complexity indicated that the instructional tasks frequently involved both diagram complexity and problem-solving complexity. Moreover, the geometric calculation with number tasks from nontextbook sources tended to be more cognitively demanding than those found in the textbooks. Implications of task analysis on geometry domain and textbook analysis studies are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

In this study I adopt an alternative approach using a response-to-intervention MLD classification model and identify the resources students draw upon rather than the skills they lack. The intervention model involved videotaped one-on-one fraction tutoring sessions implemented with students with low mathematics achievement. This article presents case studies of two students who did not benefit from the tutoring sessions. Detailed diagnostic analyses of the sessions revealed that the students understood mathematical representations in atypical ways and that this directly contributed to the persistent difficulties they experienced.

In particular, this study utilizes the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study--Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) data set to analyze the impact of teacher evaluation of student performance versus student demonstrated performance on the odds of being placed into algebra in the 8th grade. Results revealed that Black students had reduced odds of being placed in algebra by the time they entered 8th grade even after controlling for performance in mathematics. In addition, teacher evaluations of student performance were shown to play a greater role, albeit adversely, for Black students than for their peers. These results are discussed in terms of both implicit theory research and critical race theory. An important implication of this study is that placement recommendations must be monitored to ensure high-achieving students are placed appropriately, regardless of racial background.

Data from teacher reflections on classroom video were analyzed to identify how teachers attended to, interpreted, and responded to what they noticed about children's participation. Findings suggest that a lens of participation supported teachers as they considered how to provide more equitable mathematics instruction. Further, the depth to which teachers noticed children's participation was connected to their positionality as equitable mathematics educators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "A growing body of literature has identified quantitative and covariational reasoning as critical for secondary and undergraduate student learning, particularly for topics that require students to make sense of relationships between quantities. The present study extends this body of literature by characterizing an undergraduate precalculus student's progress during a teaching experiment exploring angle measure and trigo-nometric functions. I illustrate that connecting angle measure to measuring arcs and conceiving the radius as a unit of measure can engender trigonometric meanings that encompass both unit circle and right triangle trigonometry contexts. The student's progress during the teaching experiment also indicates that a covariation meaning for the sine function supports using the sine function to represent emergent relationships between quantities in novel situations.

In particular, we highlight 2 key subsets of integer reasoning: understanding or knowledge that may, initially, interfere with one's learning integers (which we call cognitive obstacles) and understanding or knowledge that may afford progress in understanding and operating with integers (which we call cognitive affor-dances). We analyzed historical mathematical writings related to integers as well as clinical interviews with children ages 6-10 to identify critical, persistent cognitive obstacles and powerful ways of thinking that may help learners to overcome obstacles.

		"abstract": "In this article we report 3 experiments demonstrating that a simple booklet containing self-explanation training, designed to focus students' attention on logical relationships within a mathematical proof, can significantly improve their proof comprehension. Experiment 1 demonstrated that students who received the training generated higher quality explanations and performed better (effect size d= 0.950) on a comprehension test. Experiment 2 demonstrated that self-explanation training increased students' cognitive engagement and the frequency with which they moved their attention around a proof. Experiment 3 demonstrated that a 15-minute in-lecture self-study intervention improved students' proof comprehension and that the effect persisted over time. Thus, we argue that transition to proof courses should incorporate self-explanation training. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "• Students need to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted conception of function. • Students responded to fictitious views of function and wrote their own definition. • Students' conceptualizations and use of examples varied across curriculum contexts. • Awareness of the word 'function' may play a role in students' conceptualizations. An important goal in school mathematics is for students to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted conceptualization of function. Yet studies have found that undergraduate students often hold limited concept images for function. This study investigated 240 middle and upper secondary (15- to 18-year-old) students' conceptualizations of function at different year levels (Years 9 to 12) to consider their conceptualizations relative to certain prior learning, as theorized by an epistemological model for concept development in mathematics. In this article we draw on data from students and their teachers in three Western national curriculum contexts (Israeli, English, and Australian) to explore possible relationships among students' exposure to the word 'function', familiarity with different examples of functions, and their conceptualizations of function. Eighty high-achieving students from each context, 20 per year level, were prompted to respond to several fictitious students' views on what a function is, and then to provide their own definition. The students' responses were analyzed for evidence of a dominant meaning and any contributing ideas, as well as the use of any specific examples or non-examples of function to illustrate or clarify their views. Twenty teachers also participated in the study. Analysis of curriculum content and the teachers' perspectives on their students led to our search for possible reasons for similarities and differences found among the responses.

		"abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the difficulties faced by students when working with different representations of vectors, planes and their intersections in $\\mathbb {R}^{3}$. Duval's theoretical framework on semiotic representations is used to design a set of evaluating activities, and later to analyze student work. The analysis covers three groups of undergraduate students taking introductory courses in linear algebra. Different types of treatments and conversions are required to solve the activities. One important result shows that, once students choose a register to solve a task, they seldom make transformations between different registers, even though this facilitates solving the task at hand. Identifying these difficulties for particular transformations may help teachers design specific activities to promote students cognitive flexibility between representation registers.

This descriptive study explores the gestures undergraduate students produce when talking about the concept of standard deviation (SD). Gestures can be an important source of information about underlying internal representations of mathematical concepts, but thus far have not been examined in research exploring why concepts of variability (such as standard deviation) are difficult for students to learn. Thirteen undergraduates who had taken at least one course in statistics were asked to explain how they thought about SD. Speech and gesture were analyzed for their possible interpretation as encoding distance from the mean and frequency of values at different distances. We describe the different types of gestures that occurred in the data and also present a coding scheme that can be utilized for future research linking these gestures to students' understanding of SD. We discuss how such a multimodal approach can enhance mathematics pedagogy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Dimension analysis is promoted as a technique that promotes better understanding of the role of units and dimensions in mathematical modelling problems. The authors' student base consists of undergraduate students from the Science and Engineering Faculties who generally have one or two semesters of calculus and some linear algebra as part of their curriculum. Because of ‘In Service Training’ which is an integral part of their education, they have a reasonable understanding of the link between theory and practice in their particular industry, but manipulating mathematical formulae is not necessarily a strong point. Dimensional analysis involves both dimensionless products and linear algebra and, because of the latter, this branch of mathematical modelling was, until recently, beyond the reach of most undergraduates. However, it has been found that the skills of a good technologist can be blended with the use of computer algebra systems to successfully teach dimensional analysis to these undergraduates. This note illustrates the concept of dimensional analysis by examining the simple pendulum problem and shows how dimensionless products can lead to the discovery of the connection between the period of the pendulum swing and its length. Dimensional analysis is shown to lead to interesting systems of linear equations to solve, and can point the way to more quantitative analysis, and two student problems are discussed. It is the authors' experience that dimensional analysis broadens a student's viewpoint to include units and dimensions as an integral part of any physical problem. With this approach coupled with a computer algebra systems such as DERIVE, students can concentrate on understanding the model and the modelling process rather than the solution technique. Finally, it has been observed that students find dimensional analysis fun to do. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

To this end, I present a detailed analysis of an excerpt of paired discourse by undergraduate mathematics majors working on an introductory proof task. Additionally, I draw on the excerpt to illustrate that there exists in discourse between novice interlocutors natural opportunities, especially ripe with potential, in which experts could intervene to steer the discourse toward increasing mathematical sophistication. I have named these opportunities discursive entry points and suggest their identification as significant in addressing the learning paradox as it relates to mathematical proof. Overall, the findings illustrate how rich description of the nature of learning in paired discourse, a result of the commognitive research lens, can inform reform era instructional practices. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "Realistic Mathematics Education supports students' formalization of their mathematical activity through guided reinvention. To operationalize \"formalization\" in a proof-oriented instructional context, I adapt Sjogren's (2010) claim that formal proof explicates (Carnap, 1950) informal proof. Explication means replacing unscientific or informal concepts with scientific ones. I use Carnap's criteria for successful explication - similarity, exactness, and fruitfulness - to demonstrate how the elements of mathematical theory - definitions, axioms, theorems, proofs - can each explicate their less formal correlates. This lens supports an express goal of the instructional project, which is to help students coordinate semantic (informal) and syntactic (formal) mathematical activity. I demonstrate the analytical value of the explication lens by applying it to examples of students' mathematical activity drawn from a design experiment in undergraduate, neutral axiomatic geometry. I analyze the chains of meanings (Thompson, 2013) that emerged when formal elements were presented readymade alongside those emerging from guided reinvention. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

These new directions seek to guide students into a more interpretive mode of thinking and to enhance their ability to graphically and numerically analyze differential equations. The framework reported here is the result of investigating in depth six students' understandings through a series of task-based individual interviews and classroom observations. The two major themes of the framework, the function-as-solution dilemma theme and students' intuitions and images theme, extend previous research on student cognition at the secondary and collegiate level to the domain of differential equations and reflect the increased recognition of situating analyses of student learning within students' learning environment.

Therefore, dynamic reasoning is defined as developing and using conceptualizations about time as a parameter that implicitly or explicitly coordinates with other quantities to understand and solve problems. Students participate in the following types of mathematical activity related to dynamic reasoning: making time an explicit quantity, using the metaphor of time as \"unidimensional space\", using time to reason both quantitatively and qualitatively, using three-dimensional visualization of time related functions, fusing context and representation of time related functions, and using the fictive motion metaphor for function. The purpose of this article is to present a characterization of dynamic reasoning and promote more explicit attention to this type of reasoning by teachers in K-16 mathematics in order to improve student understanding in time related areas of mathematics. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We draw from the experiences of prospective teachers in the Department of Mathematics at our institution in designing, implementing (i.e. computer programming) and testing mathematics learning objects. Based on Mason's work on awareness, a pilot small-scale study, and reflections on practice, we identified ownership, engagement, and pride as keys for positive learning experiences. We postulated that prospective teachers experience more ownership, engagement and pride while creating learning objects than doing more traditional tasks. This called for a large-scale study and hence a need for a conceptual framework. Embedded in our research is the question of whether there is a shift in prospective teachers' relationships to mathematics and mathematics didactics in terms of ownership, engagement and pride provoked by one activity relative to another. We characterize this shift as 'repositioning.'.",

		"abstract": "How can active learning, peer learning and prompt feedback be achieved in large first-year mathematics classes? Further, what technologies may support these aims? In this article, we assert that test revision sessions in first-year mathematics held in a technology-enhanced lecture theatre can be highly interactive with students solving problems, learning from each other and receiving immediate feedback. This is facilitated by pen-enabled screens and synchronization software. We argue that the educational benefits achievable through the technology do outweigh the technological distractions, and that these benefits can be achieved by focused, targeted one-off sessions and not only by a semester-long, regular approach. Repeat mid-semester test revision sessions were offered on a non-compulsory basis using pen-enabled screens for all students. Students worked practice test questions and marked solutions to mathematical problems on the screens. Students' work was then displayed anonymously for their peers to see. Answers were discussed with the whole class. We discuss outcomes from two offerings of these sessions using student feedback and lecturer reflections and show the impact of participation on self-reported student confidence. Pedagogical approaches that the technology allowed for the first time in a large class are highlighted. Students responded uniformly positively. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Diversity and differentiation within our classrooms, at all levels of education, is nowadays a fact. It has been one of the biggest challenges for educators to respond to the needs of all students in such a mixed-ability classroom. Teachers' inability to deal with students with different levels of readiness in a different way leads to school failure and all the negative outcomes that come with it. Differentiation of teaching and learning helps addressing this problem by respecting the different levels that exist in the classroom, and by responding to the needs of each learner. This article presents an action research study where a team of mathematics instructors and an expert in curriculum development developed and implemented a differentiated instruction learning environment in a first-year engineering calculus class at a university in Cyprus. This study provides evidence that differentiated instruction has a positive effect on student engagement and motivation and improves students' understanding of difficult calculus concepts. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Symbols play crucial roles in advanced mathematical thinking by providing flexibility and reducing cognitive load but they often have a dual nature since they can signify both processes and objects of mathematics. The limit notation reflects such duality and presents challenges for students. This study uses a discursive approach to explore how one instructor and his students think about the limit notation. The findings indicate that the instructor flexibly differentiated between the process and product aspects of limit when using the limit notation. Yet, the distinction remained implicit for the students, who mainly realised limit as a process when using the limit notation. The results of the study suggest that it is important for teachers to unpack the meanings inherent in symbols to enhance mathematical communication in the classrooms. © 2014, © 2014 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.",

This study explored whether the use of VotApedia retained the advantages of other CRS, overcame some of the challenges of other CRS, and whether new challenges were introduced by using VotApedia. These issues were studied within three themes: students' perceptions of using VotApedia; the impact of VotApedia on their engagement; and the impact of VotApedia on their learning. Data were collected from an online survey, focus groups and student feedback on teaching and course content. The results indicated that using VotApedia retains the pedagogical advantages of other CRS, while overcoming some of the challenges presented by using other CRS, without introducing any new challenges. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Experiment 1 demonstrated that students who received the training generated higher quality explanations and performed better (effect size d = 0.950) on a comprehension test. Experiment 2 demonstrated that self-explanation training increased students' cognitive engagement and the frequency with which they moved their attention around a proof. Experiment 3 demonstrated that a 15-minute in-lecture self-study intervention improved students' proof comprehension and that the effect persisted over time.

The online lab covers geometrical optics and the optics of the human eye using interactive screen experiments. It was translated and transferred to a university in the USA where it was used and evaluated with a group of pre-health students. In a cross-national study, students’ backgrounds (demographic data, selected cognitive abilities, previous knowledge, and self-concept in physics), students’ attitudes towards the online lab, and their learning gain were compared. The results show significant differences between the German and the US cohorts with regard to students’ backgrounds. Despite these differences, the outcomes are similar, with slightly higher leaning gains for the US students. Students’ attitudes towards the online lab are similar in both countries but tend to be more positive among the US students.

This case study explores how a first-year university physics course deals with measurement uncertainties in the light of an epistemological analysis of measurement. The data consist of the course documents, interviews with senior instructors, and laboratory instructors’ responses to an online questionnaire. During laboratory work, uncertainties are expressed in the large majority of the measurements made by the students but only in less than half of their calculation results. The instructors’ expectations are that students systematically estimate uncertainties so that they become aware that measurements and calculations are never exact. However, since uncertainties are not specified for the values given in the laboratory guides, uncertainties are often missing from the results of students’ calculations. The potential side effects of students’ measurement understanding are discussed and suggestions for improvements are proposed. © 2016, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

Prior research at the post-secondary level has indicated a tendency for RLV use in mathematics to be negatively correlated with academic performance, although it is unclear whether this is because regular users are generally weaker mathematics students or because RLV use is somehow depressing student learning. Through the lens of cognitive engagement, a quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design study was conducted to investigate the latter possibility. Cognitive engagement was operationalized using the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F), which measures learning approaches on two major scales: surface and deep. In two mathematics courses at two universities, in Australia and the UK, participants were administered the questionnaire near the course start and finish. Overall findings were similar in both contexts: a reduction in live lecture attendance coupled with a dependence on RLVs was associated with an increase in surface approaches to learning. This study has important implications for future pedagogical development and adds to the sense of urgency regarding research into best practices using RLVs in mathematics. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

According to pedagogical literature, altering teaching methods from lecturing toward engaging teaching, which applies various active teaching methods in the university classroom, can enhance learning, student participation, decrease absenteeism, and improve critical thinking and problem solving skills. In this research study, I used active learning and engaging teaching to prevent absenteeism in an attempt to improve grades, and to enhance interest in Biology among students in large first-year Introductory Biology classes. Results show that students were less absent from the class that used engaging teaching methods (Engaging Class) compared to classes that were taught by traditional lecturing without class engagement (Lecture Class). Also, the concept inventory test showed a significant increase in post-test quiz grades in the Engaging Class compared to the Lecture Class at the end of the semester. The student CLASSE survey indicated more interaction between faculty and students in the section that was taught using engaging methods. According to student focus group interviews, students in the Engaging Class appreciated the class activities and reported benefits for learning. © 2018, Ontario Institute for Educational Studies (OISE).",

Considerable research has addressed potential advantages and challenges of teaching a flipped course, as well as examining students' attitudes towards the flipped classroom. Studies on students' academic performance in a flipped classroom remain relatively scarce, and have shown mixed results. This paper reports on a study using a flipped classroom design, combined with interleaved practice, in a 5-credit precalculus course at a regional 4-year university. I evaluated the students' performance on the final exam compared to a similarly sized random sample of students from non-flipped sections of the same course. This evaluation was done by a single-blind student research assistant, to reduce researcher bias. I also tracked students success in the calculus sequence. Since grades in subsequent courses were determined by other instructors, they should also be free of researcher bias. I found the students in the flipped sections performed better on the final, with the difference being statistically significant. I found that the percentage of students completing subsequent calculus courses with a C− or better was not significantly different between the students coming from the flipped and the non-flipped sections of precalculus. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Such problems include meeting most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced by the United Nations and adherence to planetary limits, for example, novel chemical substances being released to the environment, biochemical flows, and climate change. Such challenges can, however, only be solved via transdisciplinary approaches. They can never be fully explored by a single discipline only, either in reality or in the context of teaching and learning. In order to strengthen education for sustainable development (ESD), we suggest including geographical perspectives in science education. Geography commits itself to the analysis of human-environment systems and combines social perspectives with those found in the natural sciences. In our opinion, such an approach can increase the educational value of science learning, e.g. in the case of chemistry education. An exploratory interview study with twelve purposefully selected chemistry teachers was recently conducted in order to explore chemistry teachers’ views on implementing geographical perspectives. This study reveals that German chemistry teachers view such inclusion as generally positive, but also recognize limitations in the approach due to curricular and time constraints. © 2020, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "College calculus teaches students important mathematical concepts and skills. The course also has a substantial impact on students’ attitude toward mathematics, affecting their career aspirations and desires to take more mathematics. This national US study of 3103 students at 123 colleges and universities tracks changes in students’ attitudes toward mathematics during a ‘mainstream’ calculus course while controlling for student backgrounds. The attitude measure combines students’ self-ratings of their mathematics confidence, interest in, and enjoyment of mathematics. Three major kinds of instructor pedagogy, identified through the factor analysis of 61 student-reported variables, are investigated for impact on student attitude as follows: (1) instructors who employ generally accepted ‘good teaching’ practices (e.g. clarity in presentation and answering questions, useful homework, fair exams, help outside of class) are found to have the most positive impact, particularly with students who began with a weaker initial attitude. (2) Use of educational ‘technology’ (e.g. graphing calculators, for demonstrations, in homework), on average, is found to have no impact on attitudes, except when used by graduate student instructors, which negatively affects students’ attitudes towards mathematics. (3) ‘Ambitious teaching’ (e.g. group work, word problems, ‘flipped’ reading, student explanations of thinking) has a small negative impact on student attitudes, while being a relatively more constructive influence only on students who already enjoyed a positive attitude toward mathematics and in classrooms with a large number of students. This study provides support for efforts to improve calculus teaching through the training of faculty and graduate students to use traditional ‘good teaching’ practices through professional development workshops and courses. As currently implemented, technology and ambitious pedagogical practices, while no doubt effective in certain classrooms, do not appear to have a reliable, positive impact on student attitudes toward mathematics. © 2015, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents a transformative modeling framework that guides the development of assessment to measure students’ deep understanding in physical sciences. The framework emphasizes 3 types of connections that students need to make when learning physical sciences: (1) linking physical states, processes, and explanatory models, (2) integrating multiple explanatory models, and (3) connecting scientific models to concrete experiences. We carried out a 2-phase exploratory study that helped further develop and refine the framework. In the first phase, we developed 3 items on sinking and floating and pilot tested them with 18 undergraduate students. Analysis of student responses revealed various student misconceptions and the different connections students made among science ideas. Based on the findings, we revised the assessment, modified the instruction, and collected data from another cohort of 26 students. The second cohort of students showed significant improvement of understanding of sinking and floating after instruction. Implications and limitations of how our assessment framework can be used to improve students’ conceptual understanding in science are discussed. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

The study participants were 172 freshmen from three different mathematics departments in Turkey. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the general picture on propositional knowledge about the concepts of continuity, differentiability, and integrability. Afterwards, participants’ written answers on the concepts of differentiability and integrability were analysed, particularly in terms of proof schemes usage. The data collected during the study were analysed and interpreted using a classification method and descriptive statistics. Results indicated that many students who answered the propositions correctly could not use valid arguments for their answers. Most of the arguments used by undergraduates in the external proof scheme based on procedural knowledge and described with reference to authority did not have the content to be evaluated as proof. Although analytical proofs were rarely used by undergraduates, more valid arguments were constructed in such proof approaches. The role of definition and propositional knowledge, and also awareness of counterexample, were discussed in order to construct successful theoretical relations in a teaching environment. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Duval’s theoretical framework on semiotic representations is used to design a set of evaluating activities, and later to analyze student work. The analysis covers three groups of undergraduate students taking introductory courses in linear algebra. Different types of treatments and conversions are required to solve the activities. One important result shows that, once students choose a register to solve a task, they seldom make transformations between different registers, even though this facilitates solving the task at hand.

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how students’ high school experience, math and science efficacy, and student, parent, and teacher expectations affect their plans for college major choice after controlling for students’ gender, ethnicity, and parental variables. Over 1500 9th grade students participated in the study. Using logistic regressions, we found that males and students whose parents held degree from a U.S. college are more likely to consider STEM majors in college. Hispanic students were found less likely to consider STEM major in college compared their Asian counterparts. Students who completed more STEM PBL projects and attended STEM summer camps are more likely to consider STEM majors. Students with higher GPAs also indicated that they are more likely to study STEM majors in college. In addition, students with higher parent and teacher encouragement are more likely to consider selecting a STEM major after graduating from high school. Moreover, students who had higher math and science efficacy are also more likely to consider choosing a STEM major in college. Last but not least, we found that students’ future career choice is also positively associated with their interests and goals they develop during high school years. Other findings and interaction effects with gender and ethnicity are also discussed in the paper. Overall, this study demonstrates that students’ contemplations about STEM major selection in college is influenced by the complex interplay between the individual, environment, and behavior, three major components of social cognitive career theory. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "• Elementary and collegiate mathematics instructors considered Barebones figures. • From each Barebones figure they created tasks focused on mathematical argumentation. • Created tasks elicited different arguments or descriptions specific to grade levels. • As grade level increased, formal and generalizable aspects of argumentation emerged. We examine how instructors at different grade levels proposed mathematical tasks to support students' engagement in constructing viable arguments and critiquing others' reasoning. During small group interviews with pairs of practicing elementary and collegiate mathematics instructors, they created tasks intended to support students' ability to create and critique mathematical arguments. From the anslysis of their written and verbal work, we found that although all instructors requested explanations in their created tasks, there were key differences in the nature of reasoning-and-proving expected. Grade 1 instructors tended to focus on empirical justifications and procedural explanation; Grade 3 and 4 instructors included similar requirements, but had more emphasis on soliciting rationales; and college instructors required students to ultimately develop more formalized arguments, consistently including requests for conjectures and generalizations. The findings provide evidence for key differences in argumentation norms at specific levels in schooling, and implications for research, teaching, and curricular design. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This study examines how various teacher characteristics and contextual factors are related to early primary teachers’ beliefs about mathematical teaching and learning and teachers’ attitudes toward their own learning of mathematics. A total of 396 early primary teachers across Nebraska participated in the study. Teacher characteristics and contextual factors were grouped into four sets: teacher professional background, teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching, teaching contexts, and students’ experiences. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with each set of predictors separately, as well as with all four sets together. The results showed significant relationships between teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching and teacher-centered beliefs, motivation in learning mathematics, and anxiety toward learning mathematics. Teacher certification level, the number of college math courses taken, and perceived support from colleagues and administrators were also related to some aspects of teachers’ mathematical beliefs and attitudes. The findings suggest the potential role of teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching in improving teachers’ mathematical beliefs and attitudes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Results indicate that a majority of participants agree that software is important in mathematics but less important in teaching and learning mathematics. In addition, participants identified which software they feel has the most utility to college students.

		"abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the nature of preservice teachers’ evaluations of elementary mathematics problems using the Mathematical Tasks Framework (MTF), a model designed to discriminate among tasks according to their cognitive complexity. We also tested the relationship between mathematics content knowledge and problem length on the preservice teachers’ evaluations. Twenty-six undergraduate students enrolled in an elementary mathematics methods course at a large urban university were introduced to the MTF and cognitive complexity during a class lecture and were subsequently required to sort 32 mathematics problems according to the framework. Results demonstrated that overall, the preservice teachers had more difficulty accurately classifying problems considered to represent high levels of cognitive complexity compared to problems that were less complex. Those with strong mathematics content knowledge, as measured by a standardized test, were able to sort the problems more accurately than those with weaker content knowledge. Two open-ended items assessing content knowledge were not related to sorting performance. Finally, the preservice teachers were influenced by the surface characteristic of task length; the data indicated that the teachers tended to label short problems as less cognitively demanding and long problems as more so. Implications for preservice professional development include an increased emphasis on mathematics content knowledge as well as expert modeling of the identification of deep conceptual principles at the heart of the mathematics curriculum.

		"abstract": "This paper describes students’ perspectives of a one-off flipped lecture in a large undergraduate mathematics service course. The focus was on calculating matrix determinants and was designed specifically to introduce debate and argumentation into a mathematics lecture. The intention was to promote a deeper learning and understanding through engagement with the added hope of instilling some passion for the subject. During the lecture, students were asked to vote with their feet, literally moving around the lecture theatre to form groups according to their shared favourite technique for calculating matrix determinants. Group discussions were then followed by a whole class debate facilitated by the lecturers, before they wrapped up the lecture by resolving the professional disagreements that had come to light during the debate. Following the lecture, data on student perspectives was gathered using both surveys and focus groups. Within this paper, we share the data and reveal the interesting results that emerged from our analysis. Despite remaining unconvinced as to whether flipped lectures are better for learning, students reported greater engagement and increased understanding of the material covered. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

These were recorded in 45 semistructured interviews conducted during the 8-week Oxford University term and following minimally participant observation of their tutorials. We exemplify the four levels of SPA, across these three strands, in 12 characteristic examples where tutors discuss episodes from the observed tutorials. The design and analysis of the study reflect three underlying theoretical perspectives: constructivist, sociocultural, and enactivist. Finally, we draw on participants' comments to suggest that our methodology encouraged reflection, raised awareness, and demonstrated the pedagogical potential of collaboration between mathematicians and mathematics educators. We see such awareness and collaborative goodwill as prerequisites to conceptualizing and implementing reform of pedagogical practice. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, meaningful learning takes a central role in science education and is based in mental models that allow the representation of the real world by individuals. Thus, it is essential to analyse the student’s mental models by promoting an easier reconstruction of scientific knowledge, by allowing them to become consistent with the curricular models presented in the classroom. In this context, the study aims to examine, through the application of a diagnostic instrument (Two-Tier Diagnostic Test), what students consider to be the seismic effects on soils and buildings, to analyse and to compare their mental models about some of these issues related to seismology, applying a questionnaire to 52 students from a Portuguese University attending an undergraduate degree in Geology and a master course in Biology and Geology teaching. The analysis of the data allowed concluding that undergraduate students have more inconsistent mental models than master students, mainly concerning the factors which influence the seismic risk, such as hazard and vulnerability, and the soils characteristics which influence the intensity of earthquakes. During their academic formation in the university, teachers present some curricular models to students which allow them to reconstruct their mental models and turn them scientifically consistent, enhancing the educational implications of this study that points to the need for teachers to be aware of the importance of the diagnosis of the students’ mental models and to promote meaningful learning and scientific literacy autonomously and dynamically. © 2014, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",

		"abstract": "Elementary education students enrolled in an experimental mathematics course participated in this study. The course is taught using a social constructivist approach and is designed to improve students' mathematical problem-solving ability and deepen their understanding of mathematics. The research question for the present study is as follows: In what ways does the instructional discourse in a social constructivist college mathematics course influence the perception of mastery goals in the classroom? To determine the extent to which students perceived their classroom to be mastery goal focused, we matched anonymous student comments from end-of-semester course evaluations with items from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS). Every class session was videotaped and transcribed, with an emphasis on instructor statements during whole group discussion. The transcripts were analyzed using the Observing Patterns of Adaptive Learning (OPAL) instrument. The present study suggests that social constructivist teacher practices promote mastery goals through instructional discourse that supports students as they move toward higher-order mathematical thinking. Specifically, the results suggest that this was realized through the instructional discourse pattern of scaffolding, pressing for understanding and higher-order-thinking.

		"abstract": "While proof is central to mathematics, difficulties in the teaching and learning of proof are well-recognised internationally. Within the research literature, a number of theoretical frameworks relating to the teaching of different aspects of proof and proving are evident. In our work, we are focusing on secondary school students learning the structure of deductive proofs and, in this paper, we propose a theoretical framework based on this aspect of proof education. In our framework, we capture students’ understanding of the structure of deductive proofs in terms of three levels of increasing sophistication: Pre-structural, Partial-structural, and Holistic-structural, with the Partial-structural level further divided into two sub-levels: Elemental and Relational. In this paper, we apply the framework to data from our classroom research in which secondary school students (aged 14) tackled a series of lessons that provided an introduction to proof problems involving congruent triangles. Using data from the transcribed lessons, we focus in particular on students who displayed the tendency to accept a proof that contained logical circularity. From the perspective of our framework, we illustrate what we argue are two independent aspects of Relational understanding of the Partial-structural level, those of universal instantiation and hypothetical syllogism, and contend that accepting logical circularity can be an indicator of lack of understanding of syllogism. These findings can inform how teaching approaches might be improved so that students develop a more secure understanding of deductive proofs and proving in geometry. © 2016, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "Prospective secondary mathematics teachers are usually required to complete several university advanced mathematics courses before being certified to teach secondary mathematics. However, teachers usually do not find these courses to be valuable for their teaching. We designed an experimental real analysis course with the goal of making real analysis content useful and relevant to teaching. Our approach was to ground the real analysis content in pedagogical situations that problematized a secondary mathematics topic, where the nuances of teaching secondary mathematics could be informed by the real analysis that was covered. The experimental course was implemented in a graduate teacher education programme with 32 pre- and in-service teachers (PISTs). After the course, we conducted focus group interviews with 20 of these PISTs to get feedback on how the course was valuable to their teaching practice. Many PISTs found the course to be valuable for teaching secondary mathematics, as well as for their understanding of secondary mathematics and real analysis. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "The multiplication principle (MP) is a fundamental aspect of combinatorial enumeration, serving as an effective tool for solving counting problems and underlying many key combinatorial formulas. In this study, we used guided reinvention to investigate 2 undergraduate students' reasoning about the MP, and we sought to answer the following research questions: How do students come to understand and make sense of the MP? Specifically, while a pair of students reinvented a statement of the MP, how did they attend to and reason about key mathematical features of the MP? The students participated in a paired 8-session teaching experiment during which they progressed from a nascent to a sophisticated statement of the MP. Two key mathematical features emerged for the students through this process, including independence and distinct composite outcomes, and we discuss ways in which these ideas informed the students' reinvention of the statement. In addition, we present potential implications and directions for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The successful transition from high school to tertiary chemistry studies relies on a student’s ability to transfer prior understanding since many topics are extended during first year general chemistry. It was therefore of interest to investigate the perspectives of high school and tertiary teachers regarding which topics and concepts they perceived to be the most important and their views of student preparation. This study was paralleled by the refinement of a diagnostic concept instrument to explore chemistry preconceptions held by leaving high school students and incoming first year students across two institutions. This instrument has been shown to be valid, reliable, and consistent and has provided formative feedback to faculty and students in regard to alternate conceptions over several years. A mismatch was found between the perceptions of high school teachers regarding their students’ preparation and commencing students’ achievement on the instrument. The most important topic to high school teachers was how electron configuration relates to structure whereas for tertiary teaching faculty, it was the conservation of matter. The position and response of equilibrium to change was of lowest importance to both groups. Student misconceptions, attributable to different learning impediments, are considered and a series of recommendations is proposed to support chemistry teachers who practice each side of the secondary-tertiary transition. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: We report a case study that explored how three college students mentally represented the knowledge they held of inferential statistics, how this knowledge was connected, and how it was applied in two problem solving situations. A concept map task and two problem categorization tasks were used along with interviews to gather the data. We found that the students’ representations were based on incomplete statistical understanding. Although they grasped various concepts and inferential tests, the students rarely linked key concepts together or to tests nor did they accurately apply that knowledge to categorize word problems. We suggest that one reason the students had difficulty applying their knowledge is that it was not sufficiently integrated. In addition, we found that varying the instruction for the categorization task elicited different mental representations. One instruction was particularly effective in revealing students’ partial understandings. This finding suggests that modifying the task format as we have done could be a useful diagnostic tool.

The current study first aims to investigate the views of pre-service science teachers of science-teaching preparation degrees and their expectations regarding the difficulty level of mathematics courses in science-teaching education programmes. Second, the study investigates changes and the reasons behind the changes in their interest regarding mathematics after completing these courses. Third, the current study seeks to reveal undergraduate science teachers’ opinions regarding the contribution of undergraduate mathematics courses to their professional development. Being qualitative in nature, this study was a case study. According to the results, almost all of the students considered that undergraduate mathematics courses were ‘difficult’ because of the complex and intensive content of the courses and their poor background mathematical knowledge. Moreover, the majority of science undergraduates mentioned that mathematics would contribute to their professional development as a science teacher. On the other hand, they declared a negative change in their attitude towards mathematics after completing the mathematics courses due to continuous failure at mathematics and their teachers’ lack of knowledge in terms of teaching mathematics. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "Inquiry engagement is a newly defined construct that represents the participation in carrying out practices of science and engineering to achieve learning outcomes and is influenced by learners’ personalities and teachers’ roles. Expectancy value theory posits that attainment values are important components of task values that, in turn, directly influence students’ achievement-related choices and performance. The current paper developed and validated the McGill Attainment Value for Inquiry Engagement Survey (MAVIES) with undergraduate students in STEM disciplines. The MAVIES is a 67-item, learner-focused survey that addresses four components that are theoretically important for engaging in scientific inquiry: (a) teachers’ roles, (b) students’ personalities, (c) inquiry learning outcomes, and (d) practices of science and engineering. Evidence for internal consistency and construct, content, and criterion validity was obtained from 85 undergraduates who had experience with scientific inquiry in diverse STEM fields. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed factors that were consistent with role theory, Big Five personality traits, revised Bloom’s learning outcomes, and the Next Generation Science Standards. The MAVIES instrument is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring undergraduate students’ attainment values for scientific inquiry engagement in STEM disciplines. © 2016, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: In this paper we draw on a 16-month study funded by the Learning and Teaching Support Network in the UK and entitled Mathematicians as Educational Co-Researchers. The study''s aims were two-fold. Primarily we intended to explore mathematicians’ reflections on issues identified in the literature as highly topical in the area of teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics. We also wished to explore the conditions under which mutually effective collaboration between mathematicians and researchers in mathematics education might be achieved. Participants were 20 mathematicians from 6 mathematics departments and the study involved a series of Focus Group Interviews where pre-distributed samples of mathematical problems, typical written student responses, observation protocols, interview transcripts and outlines of relevant bibliography were used to trigger an exploration of pedagogical issues. Here we elaborate the theme ‘On the Pedagogical Insights of Mathematicians’ as it emerged from the data analysis. We do so in two parts: in the first part we present the participants’ reflections on issues of interaction and communication within the context of teaching and learning in higher education. The data suggest that the lecturers believe that mathematical learning is achieved more effectively as an interactive process and recognise that lecturing is not a method generally conducive to interaction. However, they discuss ways in which interaction can be achieved and refer to seminars, tutorials and feedback to students’ writing as other opportunities for interaction that must not be missed. In the second part, we focus on the lecturers’ pedagogical reflections regarding the abstract nature of university mathematics and, in particular, the ways in which teaching can facilitate the transition from the concrete to the abstract. We conclude with a brief evaluation of the project by the mathematicians themselves. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]",

The examination of the nature of prospective teachers’ MSMK (as well as related beliefs in the main study) informed the design and implementation of an intervention to address the issue. A mixed method approach was taken throughout. In both cycles, Shapiro's criteria were used as a conceptual framework for the evaluation of the initiative.

		"abstract": "The world wide web is becoming wider at an increasing rate. It is virtually impossible to take any kind of accurate snapshot of the state of its development. Undergraduate mathematics courses presented on the internet are relative newcomers to the race but nevertheless seem to be increasing in numbers also at a phenomenal rate. Internet education in mathematics is developing as a new mode of teaching with its own characteristics and possibilities, different from any traditional way of teaching. Research on this new mode of teaching is sparse and open research questions are temptingly plentiful. In a study presented in two parts, we try to capture the world of internet teaching of undergraduate mathematics with its myriad of possibilities. In this, the first part, we briefly list some of the technologies involved and we attempt to create some order in the huge number of activities that are available on the web. We give an overview of the scope of mathematics courses presented via the internet and attempt a graphical classification of the different types of web courses. In the second part (Engelbrecht, J. and Harding, A.: 2004a, Teaching undergraduate mathematics on the web 2: Attributes and possibilities) we discuss characteristics and implications of this mode of teaching/learning mathematics, list possible research issues and envisage possible future trends.

		"abstract": "Textbooks are a standard component of undergraduate mathematics courses, but research shows that students often do not view textbooks as productive resources to support learning. This article seeks to understand the factors affecting how individuals engage in reading a calculus textbook excerpt and what they learn from reading. To better understand the separate roles of background knowledge and other reading practices, we compare 2 readers: a 2nd-semester calculus student and a nonmathe-matics STEM professor. We employ the concepts of sense making and the implied reader to analyze each reader’s experience and a disciplinary literacy perspective to explain the similarities and differences we find between the 2 readers. We propose the concept of didactical disciplinary literacy—an adaptation of disciplinary literacy applied to didactical texts—to describe the ways that the professor drew on his identity as a teacher to shape his reading practices. © 2020, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

However, many prospective teachers see little value in completing these courses. In this paper, we present the instantiation of an innovative model that we have previously developed on how to teach advanced mathematics to prospective teachers in a way that informs their future pedagogy. We illustrate this model with a particular module in real analysis in which theorems about continuity, injectivity, and monotonicity are used to inform teachers’ instruction on inverse trigonometric functions and solving trigonometric equations. We report data from a design research study illustrating how our activities helped prospective teachers develop a more productive understanding of inverse functions. We then present pre-test/post-test data illustrating that the prospective teachers were better able to respond to pedagogical situations around these concepts that they might encounter. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "Students’ attitudes toward mathematics and the strength of their mathematics preparation typically go hand in hand such that their specific effects are difficult to disentangle. Employing the method of propensity weighting of a continuous variable, we built hierarchical linear models in which mathematics attitudes and preparation are uncorrelated. Data used came from a national survey of U.S. college students taking introductory calculus (N = 5,676). A 1-standard-deviation increase in mathematics preparation predicted a 4.72-point higher college calculus grade, whereas a 1-standard-deviation increase in mathematics attitudes resulted in a 3.15-point gain. Thus, the effect of mathematics preparation was about 1.5 times that of mathematics attitudes. The two variables did not interact, nor was there any interaction between gender and these variables. © 2020 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Mathematical creativity has been emphasized as an essential part of mathematics, yet little research has been done to study the effects of fostering creativity in the tertiary mathematics classroom. In this paper, we explore how fostering mathematical creativity may impact student self-efficacy for proving. For this, we developed new methods to study evidence of instructor use of Sriraman's (2005) five principles for fostering mathematical creativity and changes in student self-efficacy via Bandura's (1997) four sources of self-efficacy. This revealed associations between four of the five principles and changes in student self-efficacy for proving, along with two instances where the combined use of principles may have provided students greater opportunities for building self-efficacy for proving. The implications of these results for teaching and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "• Presentation of ways students can develop productive meanings for inverse relations and functions. • Arya, a pre-service teacher, began the study with limited inverse function meanings consistent with pre-service teachers reported on elsewhere. • Arya experienced several perturbations to her meanings for inverse functions, graphs, and variables throughout the study. • Arya reorganized her limited inverse function meanings, as well as her meanings for other related ideas, into productive meanings. Researchers have argued high school students, college students, pre-service teachers, and in-service teachers do not construct productive inverse function meanings. In this report, I first summarize the literature examining students' and teachers' inverse function meanings. I then provide my theoretical perspective, including my use of the terms understanding and meaning and my operationalization of productive inverse function meanings. I describe a conceptual analysis of ways students may reorganize their limited inverse function meanings into productive meanings via reasoning about relationships between covarying quantities. I then present one pre-service teacher's activity in a semester long teaching experiment to characterize how her quantitative, covariational, and bidirectional reasoning supported her in reorganizing her limited inverse function meanings into more productive meanings. I describe how this reorganization required her to reconstruct her meanings for various related mathematical ideas. I conclude with research and pedagogical implications stemming from this work and directions for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Teaching senior secondary mathematics presents a number of challenges, such as provision of a prescribed curriculum, homework expectations and preparing students for externally imposed high-stakes assessment tasks. In order to address these challenges, an increasing number of senior secondary mathematics teachers are incorporating a flipped classroom approach into their teaching. While enactments of the approach vary, it typically involves delegating the more routine instructional mathematical content as homework videos, allowing for more targeted in-class teaching. Traditionally in the domain of tertiary teaching, it is becoming more common in secondary school settings and seems to address students’ needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness, which comprise self-determination theory (SDT). This paper looks at a case study undertaken with an Australian grade 12 class where the teacher utilised a flipped classroom approach to teach mathematics 2. Data were collected through an online survey, interviews and classroom observations. The results showed that SDT was an appropriate lens to analyse participants’ experiences of the approach, with the teacher being a particularly strong influence on students’ motivation for engaging with the approach. The study adds to the limited literature on examining enactments of the flipped classroom in senior secondary mathematics contexts and has implications for practice in terms of identifying the practices and factors which influence students’ motivations for engaging in mathematics classes. © 2020, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",

		"abstract": "A key motivational tactic in undergraduate mathematics teaching is to launch topics with fundamental questions that originate from surprising or remarkable phenomena. Nonetheless, constructing a sequence of tasks that promotes students' own routes to resolving such questions is challenging. This note aims to address this challenge in two ways. First, to illustrate the motivational tactic, the taxicab manifestation of a locus attributed to Apollonius is introduced and a natural question arising from comparison with the analogous Euclidean locus is considered, namely, does the taxicab locus of Apollonius ever coincide with a taxicab circle? Second, a companion sequence of rich undergraduate tasks is elaborated using theoretical design principles, with the tasks culminating in this fundamental geometric question. This note therefore provides a design approach that can be replicated in undergraduate teaching contexts based around similarly motivating mathematical phenomena. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

There is a need to identify useful approaches and thought processes that can help students be successful in their combinatorial activity. In this paper, we propose a characterization of an equivalence way of thinking, we discuss examples of how it arises mathematically in a variety of combinatorial concepts, and we offer episodes from a paired teaching experiment with undergraduate students that demonstrate useful ways in which students developed and leverage this way of thinking. Ultimately, we argue that this way of thinking can apply to a variety of combinatorial situations, and we make the case that it is a valuable way of thinking that should be prioritized for students learning combinatorics. © 2020",

This study explored two undergraduate precalculus students' understandings of the idea of logarithm as they completed conceptually oriented exploratory lessons on exponential and logarithmic functions. The students participated in consecutive, individual teaching experiments that focused on Sparky – an animated mystical saguaro that doubled in height every week. The exponential lesson focused on developing students' conceptions of growth factors and tupling (e.g., doubling) periods as a foundational understanding for conceptualizing logarithms and logarithmic properties meaningfully. This paper characterizes conceptions that are productive for students to acquire in introductory lessons on exponential and logarithmic growth, and discusses two understandings that were revealed to be foundational for students' development of productive meanings for exponents, logarithms and logarithmic properties.

Participants were given a written instrument related to elementary school–level conceptual mathematics knowledge, administered at the beginning and end of an elementary (up to grade 8) mathematics curriculum and instruction (“methods”) course. Prospective teachers with university mathematics backgrounds did not appear generally well-prepared in terms of their ability to model or explain the conceptual basis of common elementary school concepts, although they generally claimed to feel such understanding was important.

		"abstract": "It is a well-known fact that many students struggle during the transition from school to university mathematics. The aim of our quantitative study was to clarify the role of students’ beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics for a successful transition. We distinguish between static beliefs (mathematics as a finished system of rules, facts and formula) and dynamic beliefs (mathematics as a dynamic discipline with applications in everyday life). In particular, we examined whether first year students’ beliefs are suitable to predict students’ exam achievement and their satisfaction (as criteria for a successful transition) and how students’ beliefs develop during the transition. Therefore, we used questionnaires at the beginning and in the middle of the first term at university. Our results indicate that dynamic beliefs decrease during transition, whereas static beliefs remain rather stable. This seems problematic since dynamic beliefs turned out to negatively predict students’ dropout intention, while static beliefs are a negative predictor of students’ achievement in real analysis. Furthermore, the beliefs assessed in the middle of the term had a stronger predictive power than those at the beginning of the term. Based on these results, we discuss implications for the teaching of mathematics during the transition. © 2020, The Author(s).",

However, there are rich opportunities to explore FC at tertiary levels, but progress on the area requires instructors’ attention to well-designed tasks for students’ collaborative learning. Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) provides a foundation for the development of such tasks. This article advances research on the role of task design in a FC context by considering how RME heuristics may be developed to include the out-of-class phase, where students prepare for in-class work with videos. This adaption, named flipped RME classroom design, is explored through two realizations of such a design with a group of computer engineering students during their first year of studying compulsory mathematics. Thematic analysis of the classroom observations shows that students’ modelling activity in-class is supported by the design of an out-of-class component in combination with teacher guidance of students’ modelling activity. © 2020, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "Currently, studies focusing on mathematics education pay more attention to the study of the lecturer’s knowledge, aiming to understand this knowledge, its development, and how it is reflected in the practice of teaching. Following this line of research, the present study is based in the Mathematics Teacher’s Specialized Knowledge (MTSK) model, which includes two domains of knowledge, namely, mathematical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Through an instrumental case study, classroom observation, and a semi-structured interview, we inquire how the knowledge of practices in mathematics, one of the subdomains of mathematical knowledge, is related to the pedagogical content knowledge of a lecturer in a real analysis course. The results show relationships between these subdomains considering their nature of support or conditioning. In this regard, the lecturer’s knowledge of practices in mathematics conditions his/her knowledge of mathematics teaching (e.g. techniques, metaphors, and analogies). So, a lecturer’s teaching goal is that students, in addition to understanding the mathematical contents, learn how to think mathematically to validate and construct arguments. Additionally, a lecturer’s knowledge of students’ weaknesses in carrying out proofs and working with quantifiers is supported by his/her knowledge of practice in mathematics (e.g. different methods of proofs and statements with quantifiers, as well as their meaning). In this respect, the nature of relationships between two or three subdomains of the MTSK model contributes to understanding how the lecturer’s knowledge is integrated and is a good starting point for investigating the development of lecturers’ mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "• A portrayal of undergraduate mathematics students' interpretations of the notion of key idea in proof is provided. • How undergraduate mathematics students identify key ideas of a particular proof is presented and discussed. • Variations in key-idea identification suggest an interplay between the proof and the reader. • Features of proofs that are candidates for key ideas deserve more pedagogical attention. The notion of key idea is a crucial component of mathematical explanation and a promising tool in the teaching of proof. This study investigates how undergraduate mathematics students interpret the notion of key idea in proof and how they identify key ideas in a particular proof of the irrationality of √2. Drawn from a questionnaire and students' work samples, the findings show that the students varied in their understanding of what \"key idea\" might mean. These variations stemmed in part from the different interpretations the students gave to the notion of key idea and in part from why a key idea is judged to be one. To help students succeed in proof construction and reconstruction, the findings suggest that mathematics instructors need to actively intervene to draw students' attention to features of proofs that are candidates for key ideas.

		"abstract": "Recently, Gauthier introduced a method to construct solutions to the equations of motion associated with oscillating systems into the mathematics education research literature. In particular, Gauthier's approach involved certain manipulations of the differential equations; and drew on the theory of complex variables. Motivated by the work of Gauthier, we construct an alternative pedagogical approach for the learning and teaching of solution methods to these equations. The innovation lies in drawing on factorization techniques of differential equations and harmonizing them with Gauthier's approach of the theory of complex variables. When blended together to form a new approach, the significance lies in its accessibility, justifiability and transferrability to other problems. We pedagogically ground our approach in the educational development theory of Piaget, with the results informing the learning and teaching of solution methods to differential equations for lecturers, teachers and learners within universities, colleges, polytechnics and schools around the world. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "This paper examines proof constructions in group work in the field of linear algebra teaching at the university level. Studies have shown that students at tertiary level have difficulties in understanding different kinds of quantifiers, which are fundamental in linear algebra proof constructions. This study investigates how two student groups, with a tutor involved in one of the groups, construed meaning in the context of proving unique existence of the adjoint endomorphism. The students and the tutor used certain words and phrases in the context of mathematical uniqueness differently. The study analyses from an interactionist standpoint how these ambiguities emerged. The results indicate that due to different background understandings of mathematical uniqueness students attributed different meanings to certain words and expressions, which prevented the students from negotiating a consensus during the proving process.

		"abstract": "Proof has a prominent place in the linear algebra curriculum, teaching and learning but in first-year courses it continues to be challenging for both instructors and students. While an introduction to new concepts through definitions and theorems adds to the complexity of the course, proof remains the number one hurdle for many students. How do students view proof in linear algebra? Do they distinguish argumentation and proof, and if so how? are among many questions that are still unanswered. Although research on proof in mathematics education is increasing, systematic studies on proof in linear algebra are still scarce. In this study, we examined responses to a set of interview questions on proof by a group of 16 first-year undergraduate students shortly after their final examination. This paper opens the case for a pedagogy of proof in linear algebra and examines students' reactions to, and voices on, proof in a first-year course in linear algebra. In particular, it addresses areas such as student views on understanding of proof, the purpose of a proof, and when and how proofs communicate to them. We employed Tall's Three Worlds as well as Harel's intellectual need to analyse the data. Although, these models are often applied to what students construct, we argue they can also be applied to how students perceive proofs. The results revealed that understanding a proof in order to gain personal conviction was a major concern of students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

In addition, the factors students perceived as important in their STEM career selection were examined. Participants were Harmony Public Schools (HPS) alumni who graduated between year 2002 and 2016. Data were collected through annual and additional surveys via e-mails and Facebook. Data were analyzed descriptively to answer the research questions. It was found that HPS had significantly higher college enrollment rates in all minority groups including female, African American, Hispanic, and low-SES when compared to public school students in the state of Texas and the USA. The second research question revealed that HPS graduates’ STEM major choice rates were significantly higher than their counterparts in the state of Texas and the USA in all subgroups including female and students of color. Students’ self-interest, teachers, and parents were found to be the top three factors that students thought affected their major choice. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "The Human Orrery is a representation of the Solar System at a human scale, on which positions of planets over time are symbolized by different discs. Learners can then walk along the orbits of the planets with the right pace. This pedagogical tool uses the principles of enacted cognition to promote a better understanding of the scientific laws of dynamics. Enaction assumes that cognition is based on action. Applied to pedagogy, it implies that learning of concepts must be based on gestures and perceptions first. I applied during 2 years an enacted pedagogical sequence using our Human Orrery to different populations of learners. The main purpose was the understanding of velocity and inertia by KS4 classes (14–16 years old). Interviews and closed questions reveal a qualitative enhancement of the motivation and well-being of the learners during the enacted sequence. To evaluate further the impact of the enacted sequence, I formulated 2 open questions. The first one concerns the relation between distance, duration, and velocity through the period of planets. The second one focuses on inertia and gravity through the comparison of the free fall of an apple on Earth and the orbit of the Moon around Earth. The questions were asked to KS4 pupils after the enacted sequence (experimental classes) and to KS4, undergraduate and pre-teachers after a classical lecture on dynamics (demonstration classes). Quantitative analysis of the answers reveals specific cognitive insight, especially for students reasoning about velocity and trajectories. The general purpose of this paper is thus to illustrate the use of the Human Orrery in the context of science education in the classroom and to make a first, preliminary demonstration of its efficiency. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

Yet a new focus on STEM education at the elementary levels suggests that the importance of STEM education is much broader than a preparation for workforce needs in high school or college. This paper describes a case study designed to articulate the mission and design of an effective and nationally recognized STEM-focused elementary school. As described through the six most impactful components of STEM-focused elementary school design at Walter Bracken STEAM Academy, the case study emphasizes the school's strong and inclusive school leadership, with staff organized into grade level groups empowered to innovate and honing their teaching practices. External partnerships are leveraged to broaden student learning opportunities. Students at Bracken engage in active learning opportunities and multidisciplinary lessons where STEM is used as a way of thinking and as a way to coherently combine content into active learning opportunities that are engaging for learners. By organizing the structural components of an exemplary STEM-focused elementary school, we hope to deliver actionable reforms for elementary schools wanting to increase their STEM-focused offerings. © 2019 School Science and Mathematics Association",

		"abstract": "This study was conducted among 269 student teachers at 11 primary teacher training colleges in the Netherlands. To investigate their competence in integrating theory and practice in their reflections on mathematics teaching, a learning environment was designed to evoke theory use in reflections on practice. To be able to systematically describe the use of theory, we distinguished two dimensions, which we called the nature and level of theory use. A Reflection Analysis Instrument was used to univocally code the nature and level of the student teachers’ theory use in the reflective notes of their final assessments into 1740 meaningful units. We found that nearly all student teachers used theory. However, they differed markedly in the way they linked theory and practice and with which depth they used theoretical concepts in their reflections. A remarkable finding of the study was the important influence of prior mathematics education on the nature and level of theory use, especially the low results of the third-year student teachers in their level of theory use. The outcome may have consequences for the design of the teacher education curricula and for the intake of first-year student teachers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "• A pre-service teacher, Lydia, established frames of reference in graphing activity. • Differing commitments in frames of reference were critical to her reasoning. • Lydia shifted from reasoning within figurative to operative frames of reference. • Lydia's graphing activity in non-canonical coordinate systems supported shifts. Quantitative reasoning is important in the development of K–16 mathematical ideas such as function and rate of change. Coordinate systems are used to coordinate sets of quantities by establishing frames of reference and constructing representational spaces in which sets of quantities are joined. Despite the critical role of coordinate systems in mathematics, much is left to understand about how students construct and reason within frames of reference and associated coordinate systems. In this report, we draw from a teaching experiment to discuss how an undergraduate student, Lydia, constructed and reasoned within frames of reference when graphing in non-canonical coordinate systems. We pay specific attention to distinctions between figurative and operative aspects of thought in her committing to reference points and directionality of measure comparison within frames of reference. In this regard, we present shifts in Lydia's reasoning during the teaching experiment and consider implications and future research directions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "While the lion’s share of mathematics education research in linear algebra has been concerned with the conceptual aspects of students’ learning, this study focuses on procedural knowledge that undergraduates can develop in a typical first-year course. The study analyzes the methods that a large cohort of second-semester students applied in a final exam to solve three routine problems: finding a basis for a matrix column space, solving a linear system of equations, and devising a normal to a subspace. The results indicate an inverse relation between the efficiency of the methods that students used and the number of students who used them. This was especially evident in the case of theorems, the application of which was avoided by all but a few students in favor of compound algebraic procedures. Furthermore, the study shows that at the end of an instructional sequence, many students can struggle with choosing an appropriate problem-solving method and carrying it out without mistakes. The analysis of students’ mistakes is leveraged to draw university teachers’ attention to common difficulties in linear algebra. © 2019, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",

		"abstract": "Can participation in a 4-day workshop change science teachers' beliefs about reformed science teaching? We observe a significant difference between pre- and post-workshop surveys and explore an unexpected relationship involving teaching experience. Results of this exploratory study indicate a significant correlation between high school science teachers' years of teaching experience and positive changes in beliefs about reformed teaching practices. Novice teachers hold more reformed beliefs pre-institute, but post-institute surveys revealed the two groups, experienced and novice, are statistically indistinguishable. We use our observations of the statistically significant changes in biology teachers' responses on the Beliefs About Reformed Science Teaching and Learning instrument (BARSTL) to support our claim that a 4-day Advanced Placement Summer Institute (APSI) in Biology can advance teachers' beliefs toward more reformed teaching. Furthermore, these findings provided evidence for us to suggest that veteran teachers are more malleable in their beliefs about reformed science teaching than one might expect (AP®, \"Advanced Placement®, and AP Biology® are trademarks registered by the College Board, which is not affiliated with, and does not endorse, this article\").",

		"abstract": "This paper presents the findings of a group of teacher candidates with undergraduate degrees in a STEM discipline who were followed through an intensive 1-year preparation program and their 1st year of teaching. We report on the affordances and challenges participants’ discipline knowledge presented to developing pedagogical content knowledge during their student teaching experience and their 1st year of teaching. The participants were interviewed at 3 different times: the start of their teacher preparation program, the end of a year-long clinical teaching experience, and the end of their 1st year of teaching. Their mentor teachers were interviewed at the end of the participants’ year of student teaching. Each semi-structured interview included questions regarding the participants’ discipline backgrounds and transition to teaching. The interviews were coded and analyzed to identify emergent themes. We found that having mathematics or science discipline knowledge allowed for several affordances: participants could focus on teaching, readily provide alternative explanations, and incorporate additional resources into lessons. A challenge of their discipline knowledge, possibly exacerbated by biased views of their disciplines, was making content accessible to students. We consider these findings in light of a framework we have developed for mathematics and science teacher pedagogical content knowledge. We suggest teacher preparation programs for teacher candidates with mathematics and science undergraduate degrees need not only devote specialized attention to connecting that content knowledge to teaching but also engage these prospective teachers in situations that purposefully make evident to them the need to attend to student thinking. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Along with a growing body of evidence of the challenges experienced by specialist and more-able mathematics students during their undergraduate studies, there now exists evidence that these students are increasingly accessing mathematics support centres as a means of enhancing their mathematical learning experience. Here, we report on a survey of 47 specialist mathematics students, studying within the mathematics department of a large, UK research-intensive university. Our findings show that whilst such students have high levels of engagement with core teaching components, additional, and optional, opportunities for personalized support and dialogue provided by the mathematics department to support their studies are less well used and valued. Friends provide an important source of additional support along with visits to the mathematics support centre. Our data show that users of mathematics support from later years are not necessarily returners, but instead are new to the centre. Whilst many students use the centre only occasionally and as the need arises, there is evidence that others are more regular users and are using the centre as a core part of their mathematical learning experience. The reasons given for their usage are linked to the convenient availability of support, its personalized nature with friendly tutors of a similar-age and subject profile, the ability to use the centre as a group study space to work with friends, and as an opportunity to engage in dialogue about their mathematical learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Though the ‘Mathematics Problem’, the declining standards of students’ mathematical abilities upon entering tertiary education, is well documented in many countries, its effect on preservice mathematics teachers has not yet been analyzed to date. Therefore, we analyze 17 years of data (1997–2013) from a mathematics diagnostic test taken by preservice post primary mathematics teachers (n = 365) during their first mathematics class in a teacher training institution. Our analysis shows that the mathematical knowledge of preservice teachers has declined in all of the assessed core areas of arithmetic, algebra, geometry and calculus, with the more recent years of 2007–2013 showing more rapid decline than the years before. In fact, the average-performing preservice teacher in 1997 achieved a higher score than almost all preservice teachers in more recent years. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

I call this students' pronominal sense of reference (PSR) because it means they treat terms as pronouns that point to objects, like \"that.\" The paper compares this account of reference with those assumed in common mathematical logic instruction.

A qualitative case study was conducted with 8 participants from an Elementary Mathematics Education undergraduate program of one of the public universities in Ankara. Two implementations, 1 of which included 2 geometry tasks on triangles and another which included 2 geometry tasks based on circles, were conducted. Subsequently, global argumentation structures were revealed via data analysis. The findings indicated that the prospective middle school mathematics teachers resort frequently to simple global argumentation structures since their mathematical reasoning was insufficient. On the other hand, technology had a positive impact on argument construction and global argumentation structures of prospective middle school mathematics teachers. However, it was deduced that prospective middle school mathematics teachers need to be challenged on argumentation and about how to facilitate argumentation effectively in their future classroom experiences. © 2018, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Although there is extensive research on attrition in gatekeeper courses and students' cognition about calculus concepts, there is one population in introductory calculus that remains understudied: those who failed their initial course and chose to repeat it rather than change majors. These students can provide insight into overcoming poor mathematics affect and major persistence. This case study follows eight students repeating calculus from their second try at undergraduate calculus until they graduated or left the university; six graduated with either a mathematics major or mathematics minor. While participants identified several reasons for their success in the repeated course (processing their initial failure, having a better instructor in the repeated course, and participating regularly in the formative assessments), only participation in formative assessment led to the long-term cognitive and behavioral engagement required for long-term success.

		"abstract": "The ability to reason inferentially is increasingly important in today’s society. It is hypothesized here that engaging primary school students in informal statistical reasoning (ISI), defined as making generalizations without the use of formal statistical tests, will help them acquire the foundations for inferential and statistical thinking. Teachers who engage students in ISI need to have good content knowledge of ISI (ISI-CK). However, little is known about the ISI-CK of primary education pre-service teachers. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe this knowledge by surveying 722 first-year pre-service teachers from seven teacher colleges across the Netherlands. The survey consisted of five tasks using open-ended questions and true/false statements. The descriptive analysis showed that most respondents understood that descriptive statistics that take the global shape of the distribution into account can be used as arguments within ISI. Although a majority agreed that random sampling is a valid sampling method, distributed sampling was the preferred strategy for selecting a sample. Moreover, when asked to make a generalization beyond the data, most pre-service teachers only described the data and did not appear to understand that a representative sample can be used to make inferences about a population. These findings suggest that it may be useful if statistics education for pre-service teachers places more emphasis on sampling and inference, thereby prompting pre-service teachers to engage in ISI. © 2018, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "There is a compelling need to develop an algebra teacher self-efficacy instrument (ATSEI) as algebra continues to be considered a gatekeeper course for postsecondary educational and career opportunities, which is seen as a crucial piece in closing the achievement gap. This paper reports on the development and validation of the ATSEI, an instrument that measures two domains, Efficacy To Do School Algebra (Knowledge Efficacy, KE-A) and Efficacy to Teach Algebra (Personal Teaching Efficacy, PTE-A) along six categories. Four of the categories represented content standards (variables, functions, patterns, and modeling) and two of the categories represented process standards (technology and concrete models, and multiple representations). Through conducting an exploratory factor analysis across two phases, the instrument was reduced and refined from an initial 118 items developed from a curriculum analysis to 36 items that reflected two significant categories, Functions and Technology. The ATSEI measure is validated for in-service mathematics teachers and thus provides an instrument to examine need and impact in professional development venues. The specificity of the ATSEI allows those working with teachers to be better able to support them in the field and in return positively influence the learning outcomes of the students they teach.",

		"abstract": "This paper explores analysis of feedback data collected from student consultations at two mathematics support centres at universities in Australia and Ireland. Unstructured text data was collected over six years and includes qualitative data on student queries collected during the consultations from mathematics and statistics related subjects. Topic modelling and clustering algorithms are used to uncover key themes in the data across stages. Common areas of difficulty experienced by undergraduate students at both universities are investigated and a comparison between them is shown. The results suggest that, despite institutional differences, there is considerable overlap in the types of mathematical and statistical difficulties experienced by students in their first and second year of university at these institutions. We discuss how the ability to uncover such common mathematical and statistical themes with the aid of text mining techniques can be used to improve the support provided by mathematics support centres in terms of providing an efficient and effective service. The code for analyses at both institutions is provided in a GitHub repository so other academic support centres may use it. Outcomes of this analysis have implications for mainstream mathematics and statistics instructors who wish to gain further insights into their students' learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "This article describes findings and evolution of a teachertraining program based on a partnership of knowledge domains (technology, content, and pedagogy), teaching staff (college faculty and school teachers), educational institutions (colleges and K-12), and local communities (urban and suburban). Within 5 years, more than 180 teachers from 15 secondary schools attended a 3-tier summer institute and followup activities. Summer trainees were offered stipends, laptop computers, advanced graphing calculators, smart boards, LCD projectors, mentorship, and technical support during the academic year. While teachers were initially frustrated to learn outside their subject areas, they all completed the initial workshop and more than half returned in subsequent years for advance and expert level training. External evaluators collected data and conducted longitudinal analysis of performance indicators for teaching quality and student learning. Teachers reported increased level of student engagement in and comprehension of mathematics and science topics. Graduation rates and student achievement scores in partnering school districts increased noticeably during the initiative. Comparison of target and control groups showed that treatment students consistently outperformed non-treatment students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Twenty-four participants, twelve from a well-regarded university in each country, were interviewed qualitatively at the exit point of their undergraduate teacher education studies. Analyses revealed both similarities and differences in the ways in which prospective teachers in each country construe both mathematical problems and mathematical problem solving, indicating not only that their beliefs are culturally situated but also that the concepts of \"mathematical problem\" and \"problem solving\" have different meanings cross-culturally. Such findings challenge the received view in mathematics education research of definitional convergence with respect to both mathematical problems and problem solving.

Here, sense-making refers to a process by which people construct personal meanings for phenomena they experience. This study introduces the idea of a sense-making frame and describes three different types of frames: content-, communication-, and situating-oriented. We found that students in an abstract algebra class regularly engaged in sense-making during lectures on equivalence relations, and this sense-making influenced their note-taking practices. We discuss the relationship between the choice of frame, the students' sense-making practices, and the potential missed opportunities for learning from the lecture. These results show the importance of understanding the ways students make sense of aspects of mathematics lectures and how their sense-making practices influence what they might learn from the lecture. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "Mathematical problem solving is the mainstay of the mathematics curriculum for Singapore schools. In the preparation of prospective mathematics teachers, the authors, who are mathematics teacher educators, deem it important that pre-service mathematics teachers experience non-routine problem solving and acquire an attitude that predisposes them to adopt a Pólya-style approach in learning mathematics. The Practical Worksheet is an instructional scaffold we adopted to help our pre-service mathematics teachers develop problem-solving dispositions alongside the learning of the subject matter. The Worksheet was initially used in a design experiment aimed at teaching problem solving in a secondary school. In this paper, we describe an application and adaptation of the MProSE (Mathematical Problem Solving for Everyone) design experiment to a university level number theory course for pre-service mathematics teachers. The goal of the enterprise was to help the pre-service mathematics teachers develop problem-solving dispositions alongside the learning of the subject matter. Our analysis of the pre-service mathematics teachers' work shows that the MProSE design holds promise for mathematics courses at the tertiary level. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

We used observations from a qualitative study where 28 undergraduates were observed evaluating mathematical arguments to hypothesize that mathematics majors hold four specific unproductive beliefs about proof reading. We then conducted a survey about these beliefs with 175 mathematics majors and 83 mathematicians. We found that mathematics majors were more likely to believe that when reading a good proof, they are not expected to construct justifications and diagrams, they can understand most proofs they read within 15 minutes, and understanding a proof is tantamount to being able to justify each step in the proof. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore whether a representational approach could impact on the scores that measure students' understanding of mechanics and their ability to reason. The sample consisted of 24 students who were undergraduate, preservice physics teachers in the State University of Malang, Indonesia. The students were asked to represent a claim, provide evidence for it, and then, after further representational manipulations, refinement, discussion, and critical thought, to reflect on and confirm or modify their original case. Data analysis was based on the pretest-posttest scores and students' responses to relevant phenomena during the course. The results showed that students' reasoning ability significantly improved with a d-effect size of 2.58 for the technical aspects and 2.51 for the conceptual validity aspects, with the average normalized gain being 0.62 (upper-medium) for the two aspects. Students' conceptual understanding of mechanics significantly improved with a d-effect size of about 2.50 and an average normalized gain of 0.63. Students' competence in mechanics shifted significantly from an under competent level to mastery level. This paper addresses statistically previously untested issues in learning mechanics through a representational approach and does this in a culture that is quite different from what has been researched so far using student-generated representational learning as a reasoning tool for understanding and reasoning. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Using a diagrammatic reasoning framework about inscriptions, we explored undergraduates' reasoning about complex-valued equations. Our findings suggest that reasoning geometrically requires first reasoning algebraically about algebraic inscriptions. We found students tended to create algebraic and geometric inscriptions when their verbiage could no longer support geometric reasoning. Furthermore, they incorporated similar iconic gestures for reasoning about their geometric inscriptions, which reduced to deictic gestures as they applied their previously developed reasoning to subsequent tasks. Contrary to other research, our participants' gestures did not taper off with future tasks. Rather, their gestures transformed as concepts were automatized. Moreover, our research suggests that gestures serve as a link between verbiage and inscriptions rather than inscriptions serving as a link between verbiage and gesture as other researchers claim. In promoting synchronicity of algebraic and geometric reasoning, teachers may want to capitalize on the fact that students tend to implement similar gestures as they reason. © 2014.",

The interpretative case study reviewed notes made by an engineering student and notes provided to the students by the teacher. In order to trace development, the written material included lecture notes along with notes for task solving presentations and solutions to mini-tests. Results showed that instances of relational understanding were traced, but the main strategy was instrumentalism - aiming for use of rules. By identifying gains and losses of self-made and provided notes, a further illumination of rationales for learning was obtained. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "Novice students have difficulty with the topic of limits in calculus. We believe this is in part because of the multiple perspectives and shifting metaphors available to solve items correctly. We investigated college calculus instructors' personal concepts of limits. Based upon previous research investigating introductory calculus student metaphorical reasoning, we examined 11 college instructors' metaphorical reasoning on limit concepts. This paper focused on previous research of metaphor clusters observed among students to answer the following: (a) Do college instructors use metaphorical reasoning to conceptualize the meaning of a limit? (b) Can we characterize instructor metaphorical reasoning similar to those observed among students? (c) Will an instructor's self-identification of metaphor clusters be consistent with our metaphor coding? We found that college instructors' perspectives vary, either graphical or algebraic, in their explanations of limit items. All the instructors used metaphors, and instructor metaphorical reasoning aligned with student metaphor clusters. Instructors tended to change their metaphors with respect to the limit item. Instructors were not aware of their use of metaphors, nor were they aware of their inconsistency in their choice of metaphor. We believe that instructor awareness of their own distinct perspectives and metaphors would assist students' understanding of limit concepts.",

		"abstract": "Constructing explanations and participating in argumentative discourse are seen as essential practices of scientific inquiry. The objective of this study was to explore the elements and origins of pre-service secondary science teachers' alternative conceptions of tidal phenomena based on the elements used in Toulmin's Argument Model through qualitative research. The data were collected from three pre-service secondary school teachers (D.-K. University, Teachers' Colleges, junior and senior) in the Republic of Korea using a variety of qualitative research methods. We present three pre-service teachers as examples of 20 pre-service teachers for determining each pre-service teacher whether the pattern of his/her responses to all of the questions investigating a given concept can be explained by the consistent use of components of argument. The results of this study showed \"the model with the Earth's center at rest\" backing their warrants as an element of Toulmin's Argument Model. As a result, science educators must explicitly address these presuppositions or implicit beliefs and must help the students form links between their everyday experiences and scientific knowledge. Therefore, educators must be aware of the influence of students' presuppositions and must use acceptable scientific concepts (the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system) based on argumentation to guide their construction of scientific concepts. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "A growing body of literature has identified quantitative and covariational reasoning as critical for secondary and undergraduate student learning, particularly for topics that require students to make sense of relationships between quantities. The present study extends this body of literature by characterizing an undergraduate precalculus student's progress during a teaching experiment exploring angle measure and trigo-nometric functions. I illustrate that connecting angle measure to measuring arcs and conceiving the radius as a unit of measure can engender trigonometric meanings that encompass both unit circle and right triangle trigonometry contexts. The student's progress during the teaching experiment also indicates that a covariation meaning for the sine function supports using the sine function to represent emergent relationships between quantities in novel situations.

		"abstract": "Recent education reform efforts advocate teaching the process of science (inquiry) in undergraduate lecture and laboratory classes. To meet this challenge, professional development for the graduate student instructors (teaching assistants, or TAs) often assigned to teach these classes is needed. This study explored the implementation of an observation protocol designed to support peer observation and reflection among TAs teaching inquiry-based undergraduate biology laboratories. The researchers of this study and TA-peers who are experienced in teaching inquiry used the protocol to observe novice TAs at the beginning, mid-point, and end of a semester-long teaching assignment. Novice TAs used a modified version of this protocol to observe an experienced and a novice TA. Analysis of post-semester interview data indicated engaging in both sets of observations and post-observation discussions facilitated by the protocol gave novice TAs new ways to teach content, guidance on implementing pedagogical theory, and means to improve communications with students and classroom management skills. Researchers also used quantitative data collected from the observations to document frequency of teaching and student behaviors associated with teaching inquiry and how these frequencies changed during the semester. Considerations for how to use both sets of data to inform changes in TA professional development are discussed.",

		"abstract": "The traditional lecture style of teaching has long been the norm in college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, but an innovative teaching model, facilitated by recent advances in technology, is gaining popularity across college campuses. This new model inverts or 'flips' the usual classroom paradigm, in that students learn initial course concepts outside of the classroom, while class time is reserved for more active problem-based learning and practice activities. While the flipped classroom model shows promise for improving STEM learning and increasing student interest in STEM fields, discussions to date of the model and its impact are more anecdotal than data driven - very little research has been undertaken to rigorously assess the potential effects on student learning that can result from the flipped classroom environment. This study involved 55 students in 2 sections of an applied linear algebra course, using the traditional lecture format in one section and the flipped classroom model in another. In the latter, students were expected to prepare for the class in some way, such as watching screencasts prepared by the instructor, or reading the textbook or the instructor's notes. Student content understanding and course perceptions were examined. Content understanding was measured by the performance on course exams, and students in the flipped classroom environment had a more significant increase between the sequential exams compared to the students in the traditional lecture section, while performing similarly in the final exam. Course perceptions were represented by an end-of-semester survey that indicated that the flipped classroom students were very positive about their experience in the course, and particularly appreciated the student collaboration and instructional video components. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "Slow faculty uptake of research-based, student-centered teaching and learning approaches limits the advancement of U.S. undergraduate mathematics education. A study of inquiry-based learning (IBL) as implemented in over 100 course sections at 4 universities provides an example of such multicourse, multi-institution uptake. Despite variation in how IBL was implemented, student outcomes are improved in IBL courses relative to traditionally taught courses, as assessed by general measures that apply across course types. Particularly striking, the use of IBL eliminates a sizable gender gap that disfavors women students in lecture-based courses. The study suggests the real-world promise of broad uptake of student-centered teaching methods that improve learning outcomes and, ultimately, student retention in college mathematics.

Several research-based activities have been developed, tested, and refined. In this paper we discuss how the design research approach was used to create and implement an instructional task that introduces the concept of limit of a sequence using popular characters from a children's television show. We present the intuition that students brought to the instructional sequence, the development of the tasks based on the instructional design theory of Realistic Mathematics Education, and the evolution of the intuition that students displayed after instruction. Results include the instructional task developed and student work which reveals that students use context, informal notions of limit, and the notion of 'arbitrarily close' to write about their limit understandings.

In this study, we draw on the concept of an example space (Mason & Watson, 2008) and variation theory (Runesson in Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research 50:397–410, 2006) to create a lens to study how examples are used for pedagogical purposes in undergraduate proof-based instruction. We adapted the construct of an example space and extended its application to the constructs of example neighborhood, methods of example construction, and the functions of examples. We explained how to use our new lens to analyze the collection of examples and non-examples that the students had access to. We then demonstrate our method by analyzing the collection of examples and non-examples of a mathematical group the professor of an abstract algebra class presented during lectures or assigned to students in problem sets or exams. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

'Cooling off' occurs when mathematics undergraduates lose motivation and interest in their studies, despite having previously actively chosen to study it at higher levels. We found that, despite concerns about the novel didactic contract inherent in PAL schemes, a majority of students chose to engage with the scheme, and that the student leaders of the PAL sessions were generally capable of implementing a student-centred pedagogy. Furthermore, we found that students who attended the PAL sessions had higher achievement in their final examinations, even after controlling for their lecture attendance and prior attainment. We conclude by arguing that PAL may provide a useful mechanism for reducing the prevalence of the 'cooling off' phenomenon in some - but not all - groups of mathematics students. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

It presents a case study of one instructor's presentation of proofs. The analysis shows that the instructor presents different levels of detail in different proofs; thus, the students have an inconsistent set of written models for their work. Similarly, the analysis shows that the details the instructor says aloud differ from what she writes down. Although her verbal commentary provides additional detail and appears to have pedagogical value, for instance, by modelling thinking that supports proof writing, this value might be better realized if she were to change her teaching practices. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

I provide examples of students' learning in teaching experiments connected to an advanced, undergraduate, neutral axiomatic geometry course. Students used \"provability\" relations to choose definitions, develop the notion of independence, and understand the relationship between axioms and theorems. I argue that provability promotes cognitive need for systematization, allaying concerns that geometric proof lacks illuminative value.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates interactions between calculus learning and problem-solving in the context of two first-semester undergraduate calculus courses in the USA. We assessed students' problem-solving abilities in a common US calculus course design that included traditional lecture and assessment with problem-solving-oriented labs. We investigate this blended instruction as a local representative of the US calculus reform movements that helped foster it. These reform movements tended to emphasize problem-solving as well as multiple mathematical registers and quantitative modelling. Our statistical analysis reveals the influence of the blended traditional/reform calculus instruction on students' ability to solve calculus-related, non-routine problems through repeated measures over the semester. The calculus instruction in this study significantly improved students' performance on non-routine problems, though performance improved more regarding strategies and accuracy than it did for drawing conclusions and providing justifications. We identified problem-solving behaviours that characterized top performance or attrition in the course. Top-performing students displayed greater algebraic proficiency, calculus skills, and more general heuristics than their peers, but overused algebraic techniques even when they proved cumbersome or inappropriate. Students who subsequently withdrew from calculus often lacked algebraic fluency and understanding of the graphical register. The majority of participants, when given a choice, relied upon less sophisticated trial-and-error approaches in the numerical register and rarely used the graphical register, contrary to the goals of US calculus reform. We provide explanations for these patterns in students' problem-solving performance in view of both their preparation for university calculus and the courses' assessment structure, which preferentially rewarded algebraic reasoning. While instruction improved students' problem-solving performance, we observe that current instruction requires ongoing refinement to help students develop multi-register fluency and the ability to model quantitatively, as is called for in current US standards for mathematical instruction. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

I assess the claim that inquiry-oriented instruction helps acculturate students into advanced mathematical practice. The instruction observed was \"inquiry-oriented\" in the sense that they treated definitions as under construction. The professor invited students to create and assess mathematical definitions and students sometimes articulated key mathematical content before the instructor. I characterize students' conceptions of the defining situation as their (1) frames for the classroom activity, (2) perceived role in that activity, and (3) values for classroom defining. I identify four archetypal categories of students' conceptions. All participants in the study valued classroom defining because it helped them understand and recall definitions. However, students in only two categories showed strong acculturation to mathematical practice, which I measure by the students' expression of meta-mathematical values for defining or by their bearing mathematical authority. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

The sample consisted of 122 pre-service science teachers (97 females and 25 males) who were enrolled in the Introductory Physics course required by the Science Education program. Data were collected in two successive years, after the completion of the required Introductory Physics undergraduate courses, in 2008 and 2009. The Group Embedded Figure Test and Impetus Theory Application Test (a two-tier-type test) were administered to assess the FD/FI tendency of students and to determine the degree students applied the naïve impetus theory, respectively. Initial results showed that a majority of students had made use of the native impetus theory repeatedly. The results also indicated that the degree to which students applied the naïve impetus theory was statistically related to their FD/FI cognitive styles. The findings of this research showed that there existed a statistically significant difference between the FI and FD students' degree of applying the naïve impetus theory in favor of FI students. However, the test score gap between FI and FD students remained almost constant regardless of the testing instruments utilized in this study. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Abstract In this article, we outline the findings of a Canadian survey study (N = 302) that focused on the extent of computer algebra systems (CAS)-based technology use in postsecondary mathematics instruction. Results suggest that a considerable number of Canadian mathematicians use CAS in research and teaching. CAS use in research was found to be the strongest factor affecting CAS integration in teaching. Mathematicians believe that CAS is becoming an integral part of contemporary mathematics knowledge. Two main factors impeding CAS integration are the departmental culture and the time required for designing CAS-based resources. Mathematicians mostly incorporate CAS use into assignments and much less for in-class tests and final examinations. CAS integration in teaching appears to remain a predominantly individual initiative. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

The purpose of this research was to analyze the reflective considerations that distinguish preservice Noyce Scholar science education majors committed to teaching in high-need New York City (NYC) schools from those committed to high-need rural careers. Essays designed to expose their (\"n\" = 22) considerations of teaching in NYC written before, immediately after, and two weeks following a one-week cultural and science teaching internship experience were coded to reveal distinguishing reflective thought patterns. The results showed that those (16/22) whose final essay showed commitment to NYC teaching viewed themselves positively as NYC teachers and that increases in positive self-perceptions were paralleled by increases in affinity toward living in NYC and NYC schools. Those not inclined to NYC teaching (6/22) expressed increasingly negative views of themselves as NYC teachers, NYC life, and urban education generally.

		"abstract": "Learning to write formal mathematical proofs presents a major challenge to undergraduates. Students who have succeeded in algorithm-intensive courses such as calculus often find the abstract logic and nonprocedural nature of proof writing to be technically difficult, ambiguous and filled with potential errors and misconceptions. This mixed-methods study examines 23 undergraduate students' attempts to write one-to-one and onto proofs in an introductory abstract algebra course. Data collected consisted of six rounds of assessments on one-to-one and onto proofs, including homework, quizzes and exams. Using an existing framework of undergraduate proof writing, the researchers found that students' misconceptions and errors varied substantially by student and task, with one-to-one proofs presenting unique challenges. Implications for teaching and research include emphasis on the logic of proof approaches and providing structured proof frameworks to assist undergraduates with the procedural and conceptual challenges in learning to write proofs. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Dominating OTL profiles across and within countries were identified and compared with those examined by Blömeke & Kaiser (ZDM 44(3):249-264, 2012) at the primary level. Our results show that, for tertiary-level mathematics, the secondary level demands intensive and extensive coverage of topics, whereas the primary level appears to have a two-peak phenomenon compared to the secondary level. The preparation philosophies in mathematics education are homogeneous at both school levels, although the secondary level placed more emphasis on facilitating students' cognitive understanding and cultivating students' mathematical abilities. Regarding general education, two philosophies prevailed at the secondary level: (a) comprehensive coverage or (b) only focusing on the OTL that are related to school practice; however, at the primary level, only the first philosophy prevailed. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Over the past decade, many researchers have discussed the effectiveness of clickers and their potential to change the way we teach and interact with students. Although most of the literature revolves around elementary usage of clickers, the deeper questions of how to integrate this technology into teaching are largely unanswered. In this paper, we present an implementation of a teaching model in a third year undergraduate Bayesian statistics class. The model is based on Schoenfeld's interactive teaching routine and it is enhanced by Draper and Brown's contingent teaching and Beatty et al.'s Question Driven Instruction (QDI) and the use of clickers. It illustrates a teaching paradigm which is flexible, contingent to students' needs, makes use of the most up to date information from students' feedback via clickers and benefits from the teacher's decision making at appropriate moments. We will discuss the pedagogical implications of this model in teaching. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

A Euclidean planar triangle is said to be acute angled if all the three angles of the Euclidean planar are acute angles. It is said to be right angled at a specific vertex, say B, if the angle is a right angle with the two remaining angles as acute angles. It is said to be obtuse angled at the vertex B if is an obtuse angle, with the two remaining angles as acute angles. In spite of the availability of numerous text books that contain our human knowledge of Euclidean plane geometry, softwares can offer newer insights about the characterizations of planar geometrical objects. The author's characterizations of triangles involve points like the centroid G, the orthocentre H of the, the circumcentre S of the, the centre N of the nine-point circle of the. Also the radical centre rc of three involved diameter circles of the sides BC, AC and AB of the provides a reformulation of the orthocentre, resulting in an interesting theorem, dubbed by the author as 'Three Circles Theorem'. This provides a special result for a right-angled, again dubbed by the author as 'The Four Circles Theorem'. Apart from providing various inter connections between the geometrical points, the relationships between shapes of the triangle and the behaviour of the points are reasonably explored in this article. Most of these results will be useful to students that take courses in Euclidean Geometry at the college level and the high school level. This article will be useful to teachers in mathematics at the high school level and the college level. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "Traditionally, mathematics has been taught using a very direct approach which the teacher explains the procedure to solve a problem and the students use pencil and paper to solve the problem. However, a variety of alternative approaches to mathematics have surfaced from a number of different directions. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of three teaching methods on student achievement in undergraduate finite mathematics classes at Alabama State University, a historical African-American university. The three teaching methods stressed traditional teaching methods, the incorporation of graphing calculators, and online learning, respectively. Three hundred sixty-one students formed the control group and were taught by the traditional lecture method, 202 students formed one of the experimental groups which used calculator enhanced instruction, and twenty students formed the online distance learning group. The research project examined each teacher's style and compared achievement outcomes. To investigate the performance of the students, a pretest and posttest was given to each student. The results presented a significant improvement (p less than 0.001) between the pre-tests and post-tests within each group. The students in the calculator-enhanced group scored significantly higher (p less than 0.001) on the post-test than the students in the traditional group. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

		"abstract": "This study explored the process of physics teaching assistants' (TAs) PCK development in the context of teaching a new undergraduate introductory physics course. Matter and Interactions (M&I) has recently adopted a new introductory physics course that focuses on the application of a small number of fundamental physical principles to the atomic and molecular nature of matter. The purpose of this study is to describe how the PCK of physics TAs in the M&I course was developed and enacted. Data collection began during the TA preparation workshop that was held before the semester and continued during the recitation and laboratory classes that the TAs taught during the semester. Through a qualitative, multiple case study research design, data were collected from multiple sources: non-participant observations, digitally recorded video, semi-structured interviews, TAs' written reflections, and researchers' field notes. Data analysis consisted of cross-case and within-case analyses. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method. After data analysis, 2 main themes emerged related to the development of TA's PCK: (a) TAs' PCK developed from propositional knowledge to personal practical knowledge and (b) the process of knowledge development consisted of 3 phases: accepting, actualizing, and internalizing. The results of this study will not only contribute to the quest to identify the nature of professional knowledge of science teaching but also help guide preparation for innovative introductory physics courses and other college level science courses in the future. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "There is general agreement in Australia and beyond that quantitative skills (QS) in science, the ability to use mathematics and statistics in context, are important for science. QS in the life sciences are becoming ever more important as these sciences become more quantitative. Consequently, undergraduates studying the life sciences require better QS than at any time in the past. Ways in which mathematics and science academics are working together to build the QS of their undergraduate science students, together with the mathematics and statistics needed or desired in a science degree, are reported on in this paper. The emphasis is on the life sciences. Forty-eight academics from eleven Australian and two USA universities were interviewed about QS in science. Information is presented on: what QS academics want in their undergraduate science students; who is teaching QS; how mathematics and science departments work together to build QS in science and implications for building the QS of science students. This information leads to suggestions for improvement in QS within a science curriculum. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

An attitude toward mathematics inventory, course performance, readiness assessment, and student interviews were used to determine characteristics and behaviors of students who succeeded in the course. In addition to student indicators, difficult topics and suggestions for improvement in the course structure were identified. While the focus of this study was on student indicators, the analyses of instructor interviews were included in order to compare their views with those of the students. The quantitative analyses showed that high school grade point average and the Calculus Readiness Assessment had positive significant correlations with course performance.

Given the increased societal demand for STEM careers, the relationships among classroom climate, self-efficacy, and achievement in undergraduate mathematics needed to be examined. A purposeful sample of college algebra instructors (n = 15), employed at public 4-year universities in various states (n = 10) across the nation, was administered the Principles of Adult Learning Scale at the beginning of the semester to assess classroom climate. At the end of the course semester, their college algebra students (n = 326) were administered the Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale-Revised and final college algebra examinations. The results of the multi-level analysis indicated: (a) students having higher mathematics self-efficacy also had higher mathematics achievement, (b) teacher-centered classroom climates had greater mathematics self-efficacy levels, (c) classroom climate was not a significant predictor of mathematics achievement, (c) classroom climate did not moderate the relationship between mathematics self-efficacy and achievement, and (d) although boys reported higher mathematics self-efficacy than girls, gender differences were not found to exist in regard to mathematics achievement. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "The phenomenon of birth of a baby is a common and familiar one, and yet college students participating in a general biology class did not possess the expected common knowledge of the equal probability of gender births. We found that these students held strikingly skewed conceptions regarding gender birth ratio, estimating the number of female births to be more than twice the number of male births. Possible sources of these beliefs were analysed, showing flaws in statistical thinking such as viewing small unplanned samples as representing the whole population and making inferences from an inappropriate population. Some educational implications are discussed and a short teaching example (using data assembly) demonstrates an instructional direction that might facilitate conceptual change. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This study considers tertiary calculus students' and instructors' conceptualizations of slope. Qualitative techniques were employed to classify responses to 5 items using conceptualizations of slope identified across various research settings. Students' responses suggest that they rely on procedurally based conceptualizations of slope, showing little evidence of covariational reasoning. In contrast, instructors' responses demonstrated a multi-dimensional understanding of slope as a functional property, which applies to real-world situations and plays an integral role in the development of key calculus concepts. While relatively diverse, the instructors' responses seldom reported determining increasing or decreasing trends of a line from its slope. This conceptualization was used frequently by students and could help them better understand how slope ties to positive and negative derivatives. The most frequently used conceptualizations for students in this study align with past research findings on the emphasis of the secondary mathematics curriculum, supporting the possibility of cultural influences (academic and geographic) on individuals' conceptualizations of slope. Thus, this study provides valuable insight into conceptualizations of slope and provides direction for future research on slope and the broader topic of cultural influences on mathematical meaning. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

Analysis of the development of algebra reveals that these successive meanings that the student has met before often become problematic, leading to a fragile knowledge structure that lacks flexibility and leads to confusion and long-term disaffection. The problematic aspects that arise from changes in meaning of the minus sign are identified and the iconic function machine is utilized as a supportive strategy, along with formative assessment to encourage teachers and learners to seek more flexible and effective ways of making sense of increasingly sophisticated mathematics. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates the similarities and differences of mathematics-related teaching competencies between the future secondary school teachers of Taiwan and Singapore by using data from the international Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), organized by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Taiwan and Singapore are identified as the only two Asian countries integrating the Chinese/Confucian tradition in their education regarding TEDS-M. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these two countries, as compared to other TEDS-M higher-achieving Western countries, such as Germany, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, and the USA, are examined after reselecting and reclassifying the achievement items based on Niss' (2003) mathematics competence and Hsieh's (Secondary Education, 63(3), 2012) mathematics teaching competence structures. This study shows that Singaporean future teachers are weaker in the competence of devising formal mathematical arguments and transforming heuristic ideas into valid proofs than Taiwanese future teachers. Taiwan and Singapore demonstrate relative strengths at primary, lower-, and upper-secondary levels in mathematics competencies but show relative weaknesses at the tertiary level than do other higher-achieving Western countries. Comparing these two countries, Taiwan shows relative strengths at upper-secondary and tertiary levels, and Singaporean strengths are at primary and lower-secondary levels. This distinction is primarily because of the thought-oriented category of mathematics competencies. This study also finds that Taiwan and Singapore belong to different clusters compared with the higher-achieving Western countries regarding their future teachers' relative strengths and weaknesses in either mathematics or mathematics teaching competence. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Over the past years we have been involved in a series of studies researching the teaching and learning of linear algebra at the undergraduate level in the United States. Through work with our research colleagues and our own teaching of linear algebra we have come to reflect on the nature of the cognitive demands that an introductory undergraduate linear algebra course places on students. Many of the struggles students face are related to a central set of ideas. In this article, we present a framework that offers insight into student thinking related to these central ideas. This framework can serve as a tool for researchers, curriculum designers and instructors to deconstruct their expert knowledge in order to anticipate challenges that students may face. The framework also functions as a diagnostic tool that can be helpful in making sense of the unexpected and seemingly idiosyncratic ways in which students often blend ideas, particularly as they begin learning linear algebra.",

		"abstract": "Given the acknowledged relationship between teachers' knowledge, their teaching and pupil learning, teachers' mathematics subject matter knowledge (MSMK) has received increased attention internationally. As children's early mathematics experiences have been recognized as a critical stage, elementary teachers' MSMK has become a focal point among researchers and policy makers alike. International research findings have uncovered that in many cases, there is a mismatch between what is perceived to be an appropriate MSMK for teaching elementary mathematics and that demonstrated by many qualified and prospective elementary teachers. Following repeated incidences of weak MSMK during interactions with prospective elementary teachers in one Irish College of Education (provider of initial teacher education programme for elementary teachers), this study sought to examine and address the issue purposefully through two cycles of action research. This article focuses on the data collected prospective teachers' MSMK in the initial stage (reconnaissance) of these cycles, i.e. pre-test findings. While considerable differences were evident among the pre-test population, the findings suggest that prior to the intervention stage many participating prospective teachers; regardless of previous mathematics achievements or the level of mathematics study; demonstrate weaknesses and gaps in their 'common' MSMK. Particular difficulties were evident in relation to pre-test items requiring knowledge of rational numbers, conceptual understanding or problem solving. These findings highlight the inadequacy of previous mathematics achievements and indeed minimum entry requirements as predictors of MSMK for teaching. As well as its contribution at a local and national level, the findings provide an Irish perspective on this international issue. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The effective integration of technology into the teaching and learning of mathematics remains one of the critical challenges facing contemporary tertiary mathematics. This article reports on some significant findings of a wider study investigating the use of technology in undergraduate mathematics. It first discusses a taxonomy developed to describe and compare technology use within individual courses and departments that identifies a complex range of factors, summarized under six defining characteristics of an integrated technology mathematics curriculum (ITMC). An instrument for a simple comparison of technology use employing the elements of this taxonomy is provided. It then presents evidence gathered from an observational study of technology implementation at The University of Auckland, and examines this evidence against the taxonomy. The findings suggest that while the underlying complexity of the taxonomy limits a categorical definition of integrated technology, it does provide an effective means for examining the issues confronting those wishing to implement and sustain integrated technology in undergraduate mathematics. An integrated, holistic approach, which aims for curricular consistency across all the characteristics described in the taxonomy, provides the basis for a more effective and sustainable ITMC. Key findings, some of which will be considered in more detail in this discussion, include: the importance of mandating technology use in official departmental policy; paying attention to consistency and fairness in assessment; re-evaluating the value of topics in the curriculum; re-establishing the goals of undergraduate courses; and developing the pedagogical technical knowledge of teaching staff. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

These changes have had a cumulative effect on the readiness of mathematics students for tertiary education. Furthermore the need for university staff to be accountable to both community and students adds to the responsibility of university mathematics departments to adapt and change to suit this environment and create new educational frameworks. This paper reviews the changes in a third year (qualifying course) in mathematics at a South African university over a period of 10 years. These changes are interrogated in the light of the international call for changes at tertiary level and the changing dynamics of the student cohort.

		"abstract": "The development of statistical literacy is fast becoming the focus of a large part of mathematics instruction at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. This broadening of the mathematics curriculum to encompass a focus on statistics makes considerable demands on teachers. Most mathematics teachers acknowledge the practical importance of statistics and are willing to give more relevance to the teaching of statistics; however, many mathematics teachers do not consider themselves well prepared to teach statistics. The aims of this study were to investigate the conceptual understanding of statistics of prospective secondary mathematics teachers; the nature of their attitudes towards statistics and if there was a relationship between attitude towards statistics and conceptual understanding of statistics. Conceptual understanding was measured using a standard assessment instrument (comprehensive assessment of outcomes in a first statistics course) which allows comparison across other disciplines. Despite being very mathematically able and confident, the prospective mathematics teachers in this study do no better in the assessment than students from other (mostly non-quantitative) disciplines. This, perhaps, gives further evidence that statistical thinking is different from mathematical thinking and that a strong background in mathematics does not necessarily translate to statistical thinking. Conceptual knowledge was poor in some fundamental areas of statistics such as being able to properly describe the distribution of a quantitative variable and data production. The attitudes of these teachers towards statistics were measured using a widely used instrument (survey of attitudes towards statistics). The results indicate generally positive attitudes but an acknowledgement that statistics is not a subject quickly learned by everyone and requires discipline to learn. No strong correlation was found between attitudes and conceptual knowledge. It is recommended that in order to improve teacher knowledge, teacher education programmes must include tailored modules in statistics and highlight the differences between mathematical and statistical thinking.

		"abstract": "Linear algebra with its rich theoretical nature is a first step towards advanced mathematical thinking for many undergraduate students. In this paper, we consider the teaching approach of an experienced mathematician as he attempts to engage his students with the key ideas embedded in a second-year course in linear algebra. We describe his approach in both lectures and tutorials, and how he employed visualization and an emphasis on language to encourage conceptual thinking. We use Tall's framework of three worlds of mathematical thinking to reflect on the effect of these activities in students' learning. An analysis of students' attitudes to the course and their test and examination results help to answer questions about the value of such an approach, suggesting ways forward in teaching linear algebra. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

There is also some research on teaching of limits but it is not yet as extensive as the research on student learning about limits. This study explores the discourse on limits in a beginning-level undergraduate calculus classroom by focusing on one instructor's and his students' discourses through a communicational approach to cognition. The findings indicate that some of the limit-related contexts in which students struggled coincided with those in which the instructor shifted his elements of discourse on limits. The instructor did not attend to the shifts in his discourse, making them implicit for the students. The study highlights that the discrepancies among participants' discourses signal communicational breakages and suggests that future studies should examine whether teachers' explicit attention to the elements of their discourse can enhance communication in the classrooms. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

		"abstract": "Today's scientist is faced with complex problems that require interdisciplinary solutions. Consequently, tertiary science educators have had to develop and deliver interdisciplinary science courses to equip students with the skills required to solve the evolving real-world challenges of today and tomorrow. There are few reported studies of the lessons learned from designing and delivering first year compulsory interdisciplinary science subjects at regional universities. Even fewer studies assess the impact that teaching interventions within interdisciplinary courses have on students' attitudes towards mathematics and technology, and mathematics anxiety. This paper discusses the feedback received from the first student cohort of a new compulsory, first year interdisciplinary science subject at a regional Australian university which resulted in curricular revisions. These revisions included a greater emphasis on the subject relevance and increased student support in tutorials. Assessment practices were also dramatically modified. The change in student attitudes and anxiety levels a priori and a posteriori to the interventions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Post-intervention, female and non-mathematics major students had grown in mathematical confidence and were less anxious. It is important that positive and negative research findings are reported, so science educators can learn from one another, and can better prepare their students for the challenges they will face in bringing interdisciplinary solutions to contemporary real-world problems. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

Previous studies comparing college or high school student performance in online and face-to-face courses found, in most cases, similar achievement between conditions. However, research is lacking regarding middle school students' academic performance and attitudes toward online learning. This counterbalanced, repeated measures study examined a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data examining the attitudes of 46 Caucasian sixth grade middle school students (24m, 22f) as they studied ten mathematics topics, alternating between online learning using laptop computers in a classroom and traditional face-to-face instruction. Previously, academic achievement of these same students was shown to be equivalent between conditions. Results of the current attitude analysis showed that a majority of students preferred online instruction for understanding of mathematical concepts and rated online learning significantly higher with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.72) in enjoyment of learning, although ratings decreased somewhat over the school year indicating loss of initial novelty. Students indicated that communication and the ability to work at a personal pace were two areas important to their attitudes toward working in an online setting. (Contains 7 tables.)",

Middle school students' ability to function well with this mode of instruction has not been established in the literature, although the circumstances of Generation Z growing up with technology suggest potential success. This counterbalanced, repeated measures study provides empirical evidence of the academic efficacy of online instruction for middle school students learning mathematical concepts. Forty-six Caucasian sixth graders (24m, 22f) in two mixed-ability classes participated in the quasi-experimental study in which they switched between online laptop learning in a supervised classroom with electronic communication only and traditional face-to-face learning for ten different mathematics topics. Academic performance was evaluated by pretests-posttests. All classes were taught by the same instructor with the same/similar practice problems, exercises, assignments, and manipulatives adapted for the environment. Gain scores (except for perimeter) and posttest scores showed no statistically significant differences between the two conditions; TOST (two one-sided t-tests) calculations indicated that gain score and posttest performance was equivalent for the two conditions, showing that middle school students can indeed learn online. Additional studies with more participants or greater diversity are needed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

		"abstract": "Undergraduate mathematics is traditionally designed and taught by content experts with little contribution from students. Indeed, there are signs that there is resistance from mathematics lecturers to involve students in the creation of material to support their peers - notwithstanding the fact that students have been successfully engaged as co-creators of material in other disciplines. There appears to be little research into what issues may lead to reservations to using student-created content in mathematics learning. This paper takes a case study approach to investigate the reasons for lecturers' resistance to undergraduate student contributions to learning material, in particular with a view to the production of screencasts of mathematical explanations. It also investigates the views of students producing mathematical screencasts. This study is part of a larger research project investigating undergraduate involvement in mathematics module design. Four second-year students, who were producing mathematics screencasts as part of an internship, and five academics, were interviewed to gain an understanding of their views of the value of student screencasts. The interviews focused on the particular contributions students make to screencasts, outcomes for the students and level of lecturer acceptance of these resources. We argue that students benefit from creating screencasts for their peers by gaining deeper mathematical understanding, improved technological skills and developing other generic skills required of today's graduates. In contrast, we confirm lecturer resistance to using student-generated screencasts in their teaching materials. Lecturer reservations pertain to students' lack of mathematical maturity and concerns over the mathematical integrity of the content that students produce. We conclude that close collaboration between students and lecturers during the design and production phases of screencasts may help lecturers overcome reservations, whilst preserving the benefits for students. In addition, we provide evidence that the process is a valuable professional development opportunity for the lecturers themselves. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This case study documents the struggles and successes encountered by a pre-calculus teacher while using Classroom Connectivity Technology (CCT) daily in her community college mathematics course. CCT refers to a wireless communication system that connects a teacher's computer with an individual student's handheld calculator and has been associated with positive academic outcomes (Author, 2011b). CCT allows the instructor to send documents, collect student responses, and project student work for classroom discussion. Due to the increased complexity of teaching using CCT, however, teachers often struggle with initial implementation. For example, the teacher struggled with a lack of time to plan and execute activities using CCT. She also had to develop an understanding of how to use CCT effectively and how to resolve technical issues that arose during the lesson. The teacher also experienced numerous successes. CCT was used for formative assessment, to promote involvement among students, and to exhibit and connect multiple representations of a mathematical concept. This case study provides mathematics educators seeking to understand the costs and benefits of implementing CCT with valuable insight into issues of early implementation.

It is based on Piaget's four constructs of reflective abstraction: interiorization, coordination, encapsulation, and generalization, and includes the notion of reversal, as refined into a construct by Dubinsky. Our quasi-experimental study examined the performance of two sections of first-semester calculus students at a midwestern community college. Scores by students in the experimental section were significantly higher than scores by students in the control traditional section on a posttest of limits. A deeper examination of a three-tiered subgroup showed the reflective abstraction section had moderate effect size on mathematical knowledge and strategic knowledge and a large effect size on explanation.",

		"abstract": "\"Opportunity to learn\" (OTL), a term first coined by Carroll (1963, 727) to capture the ''time allowed for learning'', is known to be a factor in successful learning during education programmes. In a major study of teacher preparation across 17 countries (the Teacher education and development study in mathematics, TEDS-M), Tatto et al. (2012, 175) applied the idea of OTL to ''what mathematics, mathematics pedagogy, general pedagogy, and related areas future teachers reported as having studied''. For school-level mathematics such as geometry and functions, relations, and equations, Tatto et al. found that OTL showed ''a high degree of variability across countries and program-groups'' (ibid, 181). Such research provides a backdrop to more in-depth studies of actual practice, because the data gathered in TEDS-M relied on pre-service teachers' self-reporting, and because more in-depth research might uncover some of the reasons for the variability in OTL. The data reported here comes from a wider study of primary mathematics teacher preparation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a country not included in TEDS-M. In particular, the authors report on the OTL that KSA pre-service primary mathematics teachers get of school-level mathematics during the mathematics pedagogy module (MPM) taken in semester 1 of their 4th (and final) year. Researchers were interested in determining the attention paid in the MPM to the two school mathematics topics of primary geometry and algebra (the latter being equivalent to the TEDS-M topic of ''functions, relations and equations''). As sites for data collection, two of the KSA university colleges (X and Y) were selected as a convenience sample. Both these university colleges teach the MPM module as 19 sessions, with eight of these sessions covering school-level mathematics and the other 11 addressing aspects of mathematics pedagogy such as lesson planning, teaching methods, and assessment techniques. Data were collected through observing the teaching of the MPM at each of the two university colleges. In particular, the school mathematics content covered during each session was noted on an observation sheet every two minutes during each 120 minute session. The data in the report show that the pre-service teachers received moderate opportunity to learn topics related to teaching primary school geometry, especially during the three sessions (out of eight) devoted to geometry. In contrast, they had little or no opportunity to learn topics related to teaching primary school algebra. Further research is needed on how to decide how much emphasis to give to the various school mathematics topics during teacher preparation.",

		"abstract": "Multimodal feedback could promote college students' con-ceptual, procedural and heuristic knowledge learning. This study used an experimental design to investigate the interac-tion effects of instructor's narrated feedback (with procedural feedback delivered visually and heuristic feedback audito-rily) and gender on their post-test performance of a similar problem. Ninety-three first-year undergraduate students par-ticipated in the study and were randomly assigned into differ-ent feedback groups. Students in the control group received visual-only feedback containing procedural and heuristic in-formation from the instructor. Those in the treatment group viewed a generic three-minute video with the same proce-dural message presented visually and heuristic knowledge in narration. A two-way ANOVA showed that students receiving the multi-modal feedback scored significantly higher than those receiving visual-only feedback on the post-test. This effect did not differ for female or male students. The result supports that multimodal feedback could be a valuable tool to improve college students' mathematical problem solving skills.

First year undergraduate students (13 from Cyprus and 14 from England) from a well-regarded university in each country were qualitatively interviewed at the commencement of their respective teacher education programmes. Data, which were analysed by means of a combination of theory- and data-driven coding, indicated that, in both countries, students entered university with beliefs about problems and problem-solving that were not only products of the cultures in which they were educated, but also frequently incommensurate with the problem-solving expectation of the curricular frameworks within which they would have to work as teachers. Also, the outcomes confirmed that, despite researchers' assumptions of definitional convergence, the expressions 'mathematical problem' and 'problem-solving' continue to be used differently across cultures.

		"abstract": "In this article, we consider the transformation of tertiary mathematics lecture practice. We undertake a focused examination of the related research with two goals in mind. First, we document this research, reviewing the findings of key studies and noting that reflective pieces on individual practice as well as surveys are more prevalent than empirical studies. Second, we investigate issues related to the transformation of lecture practice by the emergence of e-lectures. We discuss the latter in terms of claims about the efficiencies offered by new technologies and contrast these with possible disadvantages in terms of student engagement in a learning community. Overall findings indicate that while survey results appear to trumpet the value of e-lecture provision, empirical study results appear to call that value into question. Two explanatory theoretical frameworks are presented. Issues concerning the instructional context (e.g. the nature of mathematical thinking), inherent complexities and recommendations for implementation are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Issues arising in the transition from secondary school to tertiary mathematics study are increasingly coming under scrutiny. In this paper, we analyse two practical aspects of the school-tertiary interface: teaching style; and assessment. We present some of the findings arising from a 2-year national project in New Zealand titled 'Analysing the Transition from Secondary to Tertiary Education in Mathematics' supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Education. The results provide evidence of similarities and differences between teachers and lecturers in their preferred teaching approaches and assessment strategies that contribute to a transitional gap between the school and tertiary sectors. The results also show that each group lacks a clear understanding of the issues involved in the transition from the other's perspective, and there is a need for improved communication between the two sectors.

		"abstract": "The aim of this article is to present and discuss some results from an inquiry into mathematics textbooks authors' visions about their texts and approaches they choose when new concepts are introduced. Authors' responses are discussed in relation to results about students' difficulties with approaching calculus reported by previous research. A questionnaire has been designed and sent to seven authors of the most used calculus textbooks in Norway and four authors have responded. The responses show that the authors mainly view teaching in terms of transmission so they focus mainly on getting the mathematical content correct and 'clear'. The dominant view is that the textbook is intended to help the students to learn by explaining and clarifying. The authors prefer the approach to introduce new concepts based on the traditional way of perceiving mathematics as a system of definitions, examples and exercises. The results of this study may enhance our understanding of the role of the textbook at tertiary level. They may also form a foundation for further research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Drawing on data from interviews with mathematics faculty in three different types of undergraduate institutions and using Rabardel's model of instrument use (Vérillon & Rabardel ), we describe three ways textbooks mediate college faculty work regarding instruction. The model anticipates epistemic and pragmatic mediations between the instructor and teaching, others, and self, with the textbook playing a significant role. We provide illustrations of each of these mediations as described by the participants. Pragmatic rather than epistemic mediations were more common. In addition, we found that the mediations seem largely dependent on instructors' categorical perceptions of their students, either as 'math students' or as 'undergraduate students'. These alternate perceptions resulted in different descriptions of schemas for using the textbook with each type of student. The analysis generates further questions for research regarding either a developmental component or a curricular component that could explain this categorization of students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The problem is suitable for undergraduate teaching in terms of a project or extended piece of work, and brings together the concepts of geometric mapping, parametric equations, complex numbers and calculus. The Joukowski and Karman-Trefftz aerofoils are studied, and it is shown that the Karman-Trefftz aerofoil is an improvement over the Joukowski aerofoil from a practical point of view. For the most part only a spreadsheet program and pen and paper is required, only for the last portion of the study of the Karman-Trefftz aerofoils a symbolic computer package is employed. Ignoring the concept of a conformal mapping and instead viewing the problem from a parametric point of view, some interesting mappings are obtained. By considering the derivative of the mapped mapping via the chain rule, some new and interesting analytical results are obtained for the Joukowski aerofoil, and numerical results for the Karman-Trefftz aerofoil. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Partial fraction decomposition is a useful technique often taught at senior secondary or undergraduate levels to handle integrations, inverse Laplace transforms or linear ordinary differential equations, etc. In recent years, an improved Heaviside's approach to partial fraction decomposition was introduced and developed by the author. An important feature of this approach is that there is no need to solve a system of linear equations or to use differentiations to find the unknown coefficients of the partial fractions. In order to study its potential application in mathematics education at the undergraduate level, a pilot study of tryout at the Hong Kong Institute of Education has been conducted. The data are collected via quizzes, questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. In this article, the results and implications will be discussed. In general, according to the responses and feedbacks from the instructors and students concerned, the improved Heaviside approach is suitable to be introduced at the undergraduate level, as an alternative to the method of undetermined coefficients described in common undergraduate mathematics textbooks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The data (N = 118) are collected from an undergraduate static field theory course at a technical university in Finland. The data are analyzed using frequency distributions, correlation, and independent-samples t test. In overall, students' confidence grows along with the conceptual gains after instruction. The significant difference in the development of conceptual understanding between high-achieving and low-achieving students is found in the conceptual area of Newton's laws.

All sections covered the same concepts and a common final exam was given. In this article, we compare the final grades of students enrolled in the computer-assisted and traditional sections over three consecutive semesters. The success and failure rates between the computer-assisted and traditional sections were equivocal, but the success rates were consistently higher in the computer-assisted sections. In addition, the overall number of As, Bs, and Cs awarded in the CAS sections was significantly higher (p = 0.2) than in the traditional sections. (Contains 3 figures.)",

The research population consisted of second-year students in an undergraduate education program for junior high school mathematics teachers, and is characterized by almost no experience with construction problems. The results of our previous studies pointed to a gap between our intention to integrate DGS and its actual usage in the classroom (by both the students and the instructor).

This paper reports on a radically different approach to teaching statistics at the tertiary level, one that uses models and simulation as the organizing theme of the course. The focus on modeling and simulation-along with inference-was facilitated by having students use TinkerPlots™ software for all modeling and analysis. Results from a 3-month teaching experiment suggest that a course focused on modeling and simulation through randomization and resampling methods in which students learn to think using a powerful and conceptual modeling tool can foster ways of thinking statistically. Furthermore, such an approach seems to help students develop experiences with and appreciation for the science and practice of statistics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This paper is a case study of the teaching of an undergraduate abstract algebra course, in particular the way the instructor presented proofs. It describes a framework for proof writing based on Selden and Selden () and the work of Alcock () on modes of thought that support proof writing. The paper offers a case study of the teaching of a traditionally-taught abstract algebra course, including showing the range of practice as larger than previously described in research literature. This study describes the aspects of proof writing and modes of thought the instructor modeled for the students. The study finds that she frequently modeled the aspects of hierarchical structure and formal-rhetorical skills, and structural, critical, and instantiation modes of thought. This study also examines the instructor's attempts to involve the students in the proof writing process during class by asking questions and expecting responses. Finally, the study describes how those questions and responses were part of her proof presentation. The funneling pattern of Steinbring () describes most of the question and answer discussions enacted in the class with most questions requiring a factual response. Yet, the instructional sequence can be also understood as modeling the way an expert in the discipline thinks and, as such, offering a different type of opportunity for student learning.

The study suggests that the students developed a sense of communal and individual responsibility for contributing to growing the body of mathematical knowledge known by the class, with an implied responsibility for knowing the already developed mathematics. Moreover, the behaviors that norms prompted the students to engage were those that literature suggests leads to increased comprehension of proofs. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]",

		"abstract": "Student engagement at first-year level is critical for student achievement, retention and success. One way of increasing student engagement is to use a classroom response system (CRS), the use of which has been associated with positive educational outcomes by fostering student engagement and by allowing immediate feedback to both students and instructors. Traditional CRS rely on special and often costly hardware (clickers), and often special software, requiring IT support. As a result, the costs of implementation and use may be substantial. This study explores the use of a low-cost CRS (VotApedia) from an instructor perspective. The use of VotApedia enabled first-year students to become anonymously engaged in a large-class environment by using their mobile phones to vote on multiple-choice questions posed by instructors during lectures. VotApedia was used at three Australian universities in first-year undergraduate statistics classes. The instructors in the study collected qualitative and quantitative data specifically related to interacting with the VotApedia interface, the in-class delivery, and instructor perceptions of student engagement. This article presents the instructors' perceptions of the advantages and challenges of using VotApedia, the practicalities for consideration by potential adopters and recommendations for the future. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

I use elements from Defining as a Mathematical Activity framework to trace the transformation of the student''s conception from a non-standard, personal concept definition rooted in the metaphor to a concept definition for sequence convergence compatible with the standard definition. This account of the development of the definition of sequence convergence differs from prior research in the sense that it began neither with examples or visual notions, nor with the statement of the formal definition. This study contributes to the Realistic Mathematics Education literature as it documents a student''s progression through the definition-of and definition-for stages of mathematical activity in an interactive lecture classroom context.

		"abstract": "In Florida, recent legislative changes have granted community colleges the ability to offer baccalaureate degrees in education, frequently to non-traditional students. Based on information obtained from the literature covering preservice teachers' math knowledge, teachers' efficacy beliefs about math, and high-stakes mathematics testing, a study examined a population of preservice teachers in a new Florida teacher preparation program. The research investigated relationships surrounding non-traditional preservice teachers' characteristics such as: ages, high-stakes math failures, lower division mathematics history, and math methods course performance, in relation to their efficacy beliefs about mathematics. Results revealed that preservice teachers' ages, lower division mathematics history, and math methods course performance, did have a significant relationship with their math efficacy beliefs, as measured by the Mathematics Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (MTEBI); the variable of high-stakes math failures did not. Additionally, a multiple regression model including the aforementioned variables did predict preservice teachers' MTEBI scores, but did not generalize to the greater population. The findings from this study can assist new teacher preparation programs in isolating variables that identify preservice teachers who are at risk for poor mathematical attitudes; can posit avenues for fostering positive math beliefs in preservice teachers; and can recommend further research in this area.",

Research has shown that students are largely positive about the availability of tablet PC recorded lectures. However, there is some concern that the availability of such faithful recordings may encourage students to miss live lectures, which may in turn lead to lower achievement in the course. In this study, we surveyed students on their use of recorded lectures in two large undergraduate mathematics courses. We investigated patterns in their use of recorded lectures and live lecture attendance, how and why they used recorded lectures and how this use was associated with their final grade. The results suggest that the practice of missing live lectures intentionally because the recordings were available was not associated with final grade. However, those respondents who intended to watch more recorded lectures than they actually did achieved significantly lower grades. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This paper reports on a study investigating students' ways of conceptualizing key ideas in linear algebra, with the particular results presented here focusing on student interactions with the notion of subspace. In interviews conducted with eight undergraduates, we found students' initial descriptions of subspace often varied substantially from the language of the concept's formal definition, which is very algebraic in nature. This is consistent with literature in other mathematical content domains that indicates that a learner's primary understanding of a concept is not necessarily informed by that concept's formal definition. We used the analytical tools of concept image and concept definition of Tall and Vinner (Educational Studies in Mathematics, 12(2):151-169, 1981) in order to highlight this distinction in student responses. Through grounded analysis, we identified recurring concept imagery that students provided for subspace, namely, geometric object, part of whole, and algebraic object. We also present results regarding the coordination between students' concept image and how they interpret the formal definition, situations in which students recognized a need for the formal definition, and qualities of subspace that students noted were consequences of the formal definition. Furthermore, we found that all students interviewed expressed, to some extent, the technically inaccurate \"nested subspace\" conception that Rk is a subspace of Rn for k &lt; n. We conclude with a discussion of this and how it may be leveraged to inform teaching in a productive, student-centered manner. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

		"abstract": "We investigate the challenges students face in the transition from calculus courses, focusing on methods related to the analysis of real valued functions given in closed form, to more advanced courses on analysis where focus is on theoretical structure, including proof. We do so based on task design aiming for a number of generic potentials for student learning, developed from and within the theory of didactic situations: adidactic potential, linkage potential, deepening potential and research potential. The context of investigation is a first year course on analysis in which the tasks thus constructed were considered relevant to solve a number of operational problems. The experimental method involves careful a priori analysis of each task in terms of the potentials, specifically related to the knowledge at stake; this analysis in confronted with a posteriori analyses of observations of student work before and in class sessions. Two cases are analyzed in detail. While some of the potentials were partly realized, we also identified clear limitations resulting from a variety of factors, including teaching assistants’ management of the class sessions and students’ perception of the importance, difficulty and meaning of the tasks.",

		"abstract": "Over the past couple of decades, mathematics support centres have become widespread in higher education, most notably in Ireland, the U.K. and Australia. These centres generally offer a range of free support services to students who feel they need additional help with their mathematics modules. A major large-scale survey of first-year higher education students was undertaken in Ireland to ascertain students’ evaluation of mathematics support. There were significant differences in self-reported attendance between male and female students, with a binary logistic regression model showing that female students were almost two and a half times more likely to engage with mathematics support than male students, while controlling for other factors such as prior mathematical achievement, degree, and institution attended. In this paper, the engagement levels of 1633 students with mathematics support across nine Higher Education Institutes are analysed. The reasons given by both genders for either using or not using the services provided across a range of disciplines and higher education institutes are explored, with the aim of ensuring that the optimum support is provided to all students who may need such help.",

		"abstract": "Adopting Schiralli and Sinclair’s notions of conceptual mathematics (CM) and ideational mathematics (IM), we investigated mathematicians’ reasoning about continuity of complex-valued functions. While CM centers on formal mathematics as a discipline, IM focuses on how an individual perceives formal mathematics. There were four IM notions that the mathematicians used to convey the idea of continuity for complex-valued functions: control, topological features, preservation of closeness, and paths. The mathematicians’ IM tended to be grounded in their embodied experiences and espoused for pedagogical reasons, in preparation for other actions, or to assist their own reasoning. Some of the mathematicians’ IM metaphors conveyed a domain-first quality, which accounted for the domain of the function before mentioning any objects from the codomain. Given such metaphors did not capture the full structure of the epsilon-delta definition of continuity, the mathematicians transitioned to CM language in an effort to make their IM statements more rigorous. Our research suggests that while IM metaphors stemming from embodied experiences can serve as helpful tools for reasoning about continuity of complex-valued functions, one must be cognizant of ways in which the informal IM must be altered or extended to fully capture the CM. Given the pedagogical intent of many of the participants’ domain-first IM examples, we recommend that care be taken during instruction to deliberately elucidate where the IM is incomplete or fails to encapsulate the intricacies of the CM at hand.",

A simple model of educational production, which is developed in accordance with the model of Schrader and Helmke (2015), is used as the theoretical basis for our analysis. As predictors, we choose numerous variables which represent study-specific, socio-economic and biographical, motivational and cognitive aspects as well as variables that reflect the learning behaviour, working habits and the use of voluntary support (e.g., tutorials). Data from two skills tests and two surveys that were carried out at the University of Kassel in the winter semester 2011/12 and regression techniques are used to identify the determinants of mathematics performance. It turns out that the type of school graduation, final school grades, pre-knowledge and self-belief are essential determinants.",

We use students’ attention as a proxy for their conceptions and document what they pay attention to when assessing whether a proof is based on an informal argument. The data illustrate that some undergraduate mathematics students pay attention to only a limited cross section of the connections that exist between informal arguments and proofs. This indicates that their conceptions of what it means to base a proof on an informal argument involve relatively superficial similarities. Students’ attention to only a small cross section of what can be carried forward from an informal argument toward the goal of creating a proof can account for some student difficulties with, and avoidance of, using their own informal arguments as a basis for proof construction.",

		"abstract": "Research under the key word ‘secondary-tertiary transition problem’ in mathematics education points to a range of difficulties students face when passing from learning mathematics at school to attending undergraduate mathematics courses. One of these problems concerns the change in criteria for what counts as a legitimate mathematical activity. Based on this observation, the aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which students enrolled in undergraduate mathematics courses are aware of such changes in criteria and how their reflective recognition relates to their academic success. The main body of empirical data comprises interviews with 60 undergraduate students, who were enrolled in different engineering programmes at two Swedish universities and attended compulsory mathematics courses. These interview data are complemented by the grades achieved by these students on all mathematics courses during their first year of enrolment. A group of their lecturers were also interviewed. In order to explore what counts as a legitimate mathematical activity, participants were presented with excerpts from different mathematics textbooks and asked which of these they would describe as more or less mathematical and why. As theoretical resources we selectively employ notions by means of which Bernstein conceptualised pedagogic discourse, elements of Halliday and Hasan’s social semiotics, and Eco’s idea of the model reader. The investigation shows that students focus on a considerably wide range of aspects of mathematics texts by which they (mis)recognise the specificity of the discourse, and how this relates to their academic success. The study not only provides a differentiated picture of students’ reflective recognition of levels of rigour, abstraction and formalisation in mathematics, but also offers a methodological contribution.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we give a general definition of structural reasoning, followed by a typology that instantiates the definition in mathematical practices. Five major categories of structural reasoning, some with subcategories, are offered: (a) pattern generalization, (b) reduction of an unfamiliar structure into a familiar one, (c) recognizing and operating with structure in thought, (d) epistemological justification and (e) reasoning in term of general structures. The first four categories of this typology are illustrated by field-based events of secondary mathematics teachers’ mathematical behaviors. The potential contribution of the typology to research in mathematics education is that its elements can be used as indicators and conceptual labels of empirical observations. The potential contribution of the illustrative field-based events is that they can serve as initial models for structural reasoning phenomena to be examined by researchers.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, universities have been increasingly complaining that the basic mathematics skills of new students barely satisfy the requirements of many degree courses. They criticise the high dropout rates, especially in mathematics and natural sciences degrees, and link them to the lack of basic skills of university entrants. Many universities are reacting to this problem by setting up or reorganising preparatory courses in subjects with mathematical content. School knowledge in mathematics is usually repeated in these preparatory courses. The orientation of these preparatory courses is, however, very heterogeneous and ranges from the teaching of skills to development of general competences. The type of preparatory course (e-learning or classroom based course) also varies. The effect of such preparatory courses is being examined at many universities via preliminary tests and follow-up tests. Using Kassel University as an example, we are examining the possible correlations between the examination results in maths, attendance of a preparatory course and the test results at the start of the course. We are also looking at whether correlations between the type of preparatory course, classroom-based or e-learning, and the exam results can be established. We are also interested in whether it is possible to predict the course progress with the help of a test at the start of the course. The article shows the possibilities and the limits in deriving information from data on test and exam results. This could be an interesting perspective for many universities.",

		"abstract": "This study explores three aspects of a math emporium (ME), a model for offering introductory level college mathematics courses through the use of software and computer laboratories. Previous research shows that math emporia are generally effective in terms of improving final exam scores and passing rates. However, most research on math emporia does not investigate 1) whether the emporium serves certain populations differently than others, 2) the nature of mathematical learning that occurs in the ME, or 3) how the emporium is perceived by the enrolled students. In this paper, we used mixed methods to investigate each of these aspects in the case of a single ME serving nearly 300 intermediate algebra students. We found that the emporium appeared to best serve students with higher math achievement, who enjoyed mathematics, and who spent more time taking their exams. In terms of mathematical learning, the emporium appeared to improve students’ ability to recall and use formulas for familiar problem types, but had limited impact in terms of developing meaning for symbols or flexibility in solving unfamiliar tasks. In addition, students expressed mixed feeling about the autonomy provided by the structure of the emporium.",

Although the textbooks favor a conception of trigonometric functions that is based on a dynamic conception of angle, they split in their definition of inverse trigonometric functions. We argue that transparency in making explicit how these conceptions can be bridged might be useful in understanding difficulties that emerge when solving problems with inverse trigonometric functions.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we investigate task design in an unusual professional development course for elementary school teachers, conceived and taught by research mathematicians. Prior analysis singled out relevance for teaching as a critical design issue for engaging teachers in effective learning. The aim of the current research is to uncover how relevance for teaching was achieved without compromising mathematical rigor and depth. Findings are based on an analysis of three representative cases of task designing in which the authors where involved – one as instructor and task designer, the other as participant observer. Our analysis reveals a designing model that first addresses purely mathematical concerns and then refines tasks, taking into consideration a series of constraints imposed by the requirement of relevance for teaching. Using Schoenfeld’s Resources-Orientations-Goals framework for decision-making, we show how the mathematicians drew on their special knowledge of mathematical content to achieve such relevance in ingenious ways. We find that tasks were best aligned with Knowles’s principles of Adult Learning in cases where the designers appropriated the teachers’ point of view, no longer seeing the need for relevance as a constraining imposition, but rather as an opportunity to combine and merge knowledge specific for teaching and purely mathematical knowledge.",

		"abstract": "Although students’ understanding of frequency information presented in two-way tables was first explored in the 1990s, there is a surprising lack of research in this area. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners continue to highlight students’ difficulties in comprehending probability including concepts related to conditioning. Using an interactive eikosogram, a visual representation of a two-way table of information, we explore six introductory probability students’ reasoning, interaction and comprehension behaviours associated with the display. Our findings suggest that the eikosogram may have the potential to assist: proportional reasoning, ability to compare proportions, consideration of proportions in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions; the unlocking and verbalization of simple, conditional and joint probability stories from the data; and visualizing representations for independence. The students believed the eikosogram representation would be beneficial for learning probability. Improvements to the tool and task and implications of the research are discussed.",

First, we formulate this problem using the anthropological theory of the didactic, in particular the notion of praxeology, along with a possible solution related to Klein’s “Plan B”: here, re-linking the theory of Analysis with practical knowledge from Calculus. We explore two cases based on this approach: (1) the contribution of Vector Analysis to the foundations of trigonometric functions, and (2) establishing the ties between the proof of a basic theorem in Fourier Analysis and the computation of elementary infinite series. These two cases, including small-scale experiences, illustrate the necessity, importance and possibilities of new didactical approaches aiming to help student to integrate mathematical theories and practices which are otherwise taught separately.",

It does not restrict to Group Theory but on the contrary raises the issue of the teaching and learning of algebraic structuralism, thus bridging Group and Ring Theories and highlighting the phenomenon of thematisation. Emphasis is made on epistemological analysis and its interaction with didactics. The rationale of the isomorphism and homomorphism concepts is discussed, in particular through a textbook analysis focusing on the meta-discourse that mathematicians offer to illuminate the concepts. A piece of didactic engineering, informed by the preceding analysis and using epistemological insight as a meta-lever, is presented. The empirical results of a classroom realisation are discussed in the epistemological framework, through comparison of the a priori and a posteriori analysis. This experiment shows both the potential and the difficulties in connecting the homomorphism formalism to cognitive processes of comparison and identification.",

		"abstract": "In the United States, there is significant interest from policy boards and funding agencies to change students’ experiences in undergraduate mathematics classes. Abstract algebra, an upper division undergraduate course typically required for mathematics majors, has been the subject of reform initiatives since at least the 1960s; yet there is little evidence as to whether these change initiatives have influenced the way abstract algebra is taught. We conducted a national survey of abstract algebra instructors at Master’s- and Doctorate-granting institutions in the United States to investigate teaching practices, to identify beliefs and contextual factors that support/constrain non-lecture teaching practices, and to identify commonalities and differences between those who do and do not lecture. This work provides insight into how abstract algebra is taught in the United States, factors that influence pedagogical decisions, and avenues for how to approach and better support those are interested in implementing non-lecture teaching approaches.",

Chevallard and his collaborators, and from the institutional perspective of university mathematics education in France. It focuses on the teaching and learning of algebraic structures. The article introduces the notion of structuralist praxeology in the theory of teaching and learning of Abstract Algebra. The notion is illustrated by detailed descriptions of structuralist praxeologies related to the arithmetic of abstract rings, identified, on the one hand, in the history of mathematics and in Abstract Algebra textbooks and, on the other, in interactions among a group of learners of Abstract Algebra on an online discussion forum. The theoretical (and practical) issues regarding the teaching and learning of the structuralist praxeologies are discussed in the context of the difficulties that learners experience in the transition from undergraduate and graduate studies in mathematics at university. The article concludes with an outline of a research program based on further praxeological analyses of the tasks, methods, methodologies and theories characteristic of structuralist thinking in a teaching and learning environment.",

This paper presents two different questioning procedures using the methodological tools provided by the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD). The first one, leading to an undergraduate instructional proposal called “workshop of practices”, is based on the praxeological analysis of the official content to be taught, assuming the prevailing pedagogical paradigm in tertiary education, which the ATD characterizes as “visiting works”. This also seems to be the procedure many investigations adopted with regard to the teaching of Group Theory, centered on the construction or reinvention of concepts. The transition towards the inquiry-based paradigm of “questioning the world” requires another questioning strategy, to put the raisons d’être and uses of the mathematical works to be taught at the core of the analysis.",

In this paper, we focus on an SRP about the evolution of the number of Facebook users, which was designed and implemented with first-year university students. We discuss the SRP analysis paying special attention to: (a) how to enhance the internal dynamics of the SRP to engage students in self-sustained study and research activities, and (b) how the integration of the SRP in the regular mathematics course helped to combine inquiry with more ‘transmissive’ instructional devices and why this interaction was essential to enrich the students’ milieu.",

In the United States, the broader mathematics education field has begun a shift toward attending to sociopolitical aspects of research, which focus on the interrelatedness of knowledge, identity, power, and social discourses. We argue that explicit uptake of sociopolitical perspectives has the potential to offer new insights to current research and to advance efforts to address inequities in meaningful and theoretically well-informed ways. Situating our argument within the social and political context of the United States, we draw on existing studies that examine inequities in undergraduate mathematics classrooms. We highlight studies that focus on the impact of social discourses and institutional contexts on the negotiations of power and identity in postsecondary mathematics. We end by proposing future research directions and discuss challenges for equity work in postsecondary mathematics education.",

		"abstract": "Based on data from a series of teaching experiments on standard tools of mathematical logic, this paper characterizes a range of student meanings for mathematical properties and logical connectives. Some observed meanings inhibited students’ adoption of logical structure, while others greatly facilitated it. Reasoning with predicates refers to students’ propensity to coordinate properties (e.g. “is a square” or “is not a square”) with the set of examples exhibiting the property (squares and non-squares). The negation/complement relation refers to students’ association of a negative property with the complement of the set associated with the corresponding positive property. These meanings afforded students efficient ways to reason about mathematical disjunctions in normative ways. The paper also provides accounts of how students who did not have these meanings reasoned about mathematical categories in ways that precluded normative logical structure. In particular, students frequently substituted positive categories for negative ones though they were not mathematically equivalent and overly relied in familiar categories learned in school, both forms of reasoning about properties. I conclude that proof-oriented instruction may need to help students develop set-based meanings and interpret negative claims in terms of set complements in order to appropriately interpret statements in ways compatible with mathematical logic.",

Specifically, Study 1 documents students’ comparative selections and selection rationales when asked to choose the “most convincing” proof, given a constructive and nonconstructive existence proof. Study 2 further examines findings from Study 1 by documenting novices’ levels of conviction and interpretations of a nonconstructive existence proof. Findings show that when presented with a nonconstructive proof, students tended to not only find the proof convincing but also interpreted the proof constructively. Moreover, the data indicate students who exhibit an awareness of the nonconstructive structure were divided in terms of their views of which form – constructive or non-constructive – was the most convincing. The discussion considers students’ reactions to the disjunctive structure of nonconstructive existence proofs and use of pragmatic and theoretical modes of thought.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we introduce a link between the Theory of Didactical Situations and the Documentational Approach to Didactics, in order to study teaching/learning phenomena at the beginning of university mathematics studies. Specifically, we investigate the didactic contract at three levels: institutional, mathematical subject, and specific mathematical content level, and link it to the use of resources by students. Using this link, we analyse data stemming from two complementary case studies: one in the UK, and one in France. We identify didactic contract rules at the three levels for the students, and for the teachers. Moreover, we find discrepancies between students’ and teachers’ rules, and also between those and the explicit rules of the institution/s. These gaps may cause misunderstandings and prevent students from learning mathematics effectively at university level; we claim that these gaps can be reduced. Teachers could make their expectations more explicit in terms of resource use and support an appropriate use by students. The university institution could also contribute to a better alignment of the resources offered with actual student practices.",

We continue this process by using the framework to put forward a suggestion on what might constitute a “target understanding” of the derivative concept for first-semester calculus teaching and learning. We draw on empirical results from psychological research into analogical reasoning in order to create a guideline for such a “target understanding,” which includes a process-object comprehension of the ratio-limit-function layers in three distinct graphical-symbolic-verbal/rate-physical contexts. Our recommended target understanding creates a testable hypothesis, in that obtaining this target may allow students to apply their derivative understanding to additional contexts, as needed. We provide the results of an empirical study regarding this hypothesis and show that they support our recommendation.",

To capture the differences in the degree of interaction with programming in various mathematical practices, a scale of six levels has been defined and used.

Our analysis of the scripts relies on a preliminary analysis of the tasks and the lecturers’ (also exam setters’) assessment practices, and focuses on manifestations of unresolved commognitive conflict in students’ engagement with the tasks. Here we note four such manifestations concerning the students’ identification of and consistent work with: the appropriate numerical context of the examination tasks; the visual mediators and the rules of school algebra and Set Theory discourses; the visual mediators of the Probability and Set Theory discourses; and, with the visual mediators and rules of the Probability Theory discourse. Our analysis suggests that, despite lecturers’ attempts to assist students towards a smooth transition to the different discourses of university mathematics, students’ errors at the final examination reveal unresolved commognitive conflicts. A pedagogical implication of our analysis is that a more explicit and systematic presentation of the distinctive differences between these discourses, along with facilitation of the flexible moves between them, is needed.",

The aim of the present study is to analyze the way students approach the question of the existence of irrational numbers. 91 10th graders and 97 11th and 12th graders participated in the research study. The analysis focuses first on students’ conceptions of irrational numbers by using their representation as non-repeating infinite decimals. Then, the analysis focuses on students’ conceptions of irrational numbers on the number line. In spite of the fact that around 80% of the students claimed that they had learned about irrational numbers, only a small percentage of students (19%) showed awareness of the existence of irrational numbers as non-repeating infinite decimals. The same percentage of students (20%) showed awareness of the existence of irrational numbers on the real number line. I also observe some students’ answers that expressed their awareness of the existence of irrational numbers as non-repeating infinite decimals but the same students wrote that there are only rational numbers on the number line. Analyzing students’ conceptions of irrational numbers using both representations, as non-repeating infinite decimals and as points on the number line, I observe the incoherence of some of their conceptions.",

The core PAR activities required students to: attempt a problem, reflect on their work, conference with a peer, and revise and submit a final solution. Research was conducted within the design research paradigm, with PAR developed in a pilot study, tried fully in a Phase I intervention, and refined for a Phase II intervention. The department’s uniform grading policy highlighted dramatic improvements in student performance due to PAR. In Phase II, the department-wide percentage of students (except for the experimental section) who received As, Bs, and Cs in calculus 1, compared to Ds, Fs, and Ws (withdrawal with a W but no grade on a transcript), was 56 %. In the experimental section, 79 % of students received As, Bs, and Cs, a full 23 % increase.

Results show that early undergraduate students have difficulty with mathematical proof. In particular, the study showed that students’ proof choices were strongly influenced by surface characteristics of the tasks. However, a large number of students appear to appreciate and acknowledge the rigor and central role of deductive proof in mathematics despite the difficulties they may face in producing proofs. Further, the study showed a strong positive relationship between students’ beliefs about the role of proof and themselves as learners of proof, but weak relationship between proof ability and self-reported experiences with learning proof.",

Participants, all of whom had recently completed coursework in abstract algebra, were asked to explain concepts connected to the school mathematics curriculum, such as division by zero and even numbers. The analysis shows that students used three distinct explanatory strategies: Abstract Mathematical Argument, Analogy, and Rules. Students experienced competition among and within strategies. Moreover, students often derived different conclusions using different strategies. When faced with this conflict, they felt compelled to choose a strategy and to draw a conclusion derived from applying that strategy, regardless of sense-making. Students’ ability to integrate explanatory strategies appeared to depend on their possession of coherent mathematical meanings, suggesting that strategy integration is indicative of students’ having a key developmental understanding of the underlying mathematical ideas.",

Upon entry into the field of mathematics education research, these newcomers–often students on a postgraduate programme in mathematics education–need a broadened understanding on how to read, converse, write and conduct research in the largely unfamiliar territory of mathematics education. The intervention into the practices of post-graduate teaching and supervision in the field of mathematics education that I describe here aims at fostering this broadened understanding and thus facilitating newcomers’ participation in the practices of the mathematics education research community. Here I outline the theoretical underpinnings of the intervention and exemplify one of its parts (an Activity Set designed to facilitate incoming students’ engagement with the mathematics education research literature). I supplement the discussion of the intervention with comments sampled from student interview and student written evaluation data as well as observations of the activities’ implementation. The main themes touched upon include: learning how to identify appropriate mathematics education literature; reading increasingly more complex writings in mathematics education; coping with the complexity of literate mathematics education discourse; working towards a contextualised understanding of literate mathematics education discourse. I conclude with indicating the directions that the intervention, and its evaluation, is currently taking and a brief discussion of broader implications, theoretical as well as concerning the supervision and teaching of post-graduate students in mathematics education.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we present a case study of an individual student who consistently used semantic reasoning to construct proofs in calculus but infrequently used semantic reasoning to produce proofs in linear algebra. We hypothesize that the differences in these reasoning styles can be partially attributed to this student’s familiarity with the content, the teaching styles of the professors who taught him, and the amount of time he was given to complete the tasks. We suggest that there are factors that have been ignored in previous research, including domain, instruction, and methodological constraints, that researchers should consider when ascribing to students a proving style.",

We discuss the lecturers’ aims in designing the workbooks, and set these against a background of research on students’ learning of group theory and on epistemological beliefs and study habits in higher education. We organise our analysis of student responses around three emerging themes: 1) structured support provided by the workbooks, 2) productive forced study of lecture notes, and 3) engaging with proofs. Discussion of our data in terms of these themes suggests several considerations for the design of tasks for independent study of advanced mathematics.",

To foster conceptual understanding that is grounded in student thinking, we engaged a pair of undergraduate students in a ten-session teaching experiment. The students successfully reinvented four basic counting formulas, but their work revealed a number of unexpected issues concerning justification in counting. In this paper, we describe the students’ successful reinvention of the four counting formulas, we critically examine their combinatorial reasoning in terms of Lockwood’s (2013) model of students’ combinatorial thinking, and we offer several directions for further research.",

		"abstract": "We investigate the nature of Calculus I homework at five PhD-granting universities identified as having a relatively successful Calculus I program and compare features of homework at these universities to comparable universities that were not selected as having a successful program. Mixed method analyses point to three aspects of homework that arose as important: structure, content, and feedback. Selected universities employed more varied homework structure, included more content emphasizing skills as well as solving novel problems, and provided higher amounts of and frequency of feedback to students. Students felt positively towards conceptually driven homework, but their feelings were mixed or negative regarding the logistical aspects of online and group homework assignments. We draw on Herbst and Chazan’s (ZDM – The International Journal on Mathematics Education, 44(5), 601–612, 2012) adaptation of the instructional triangle and Brousseau’s (1997) notion of the didactical contract to make sense of how homework is understood as an instructional resource by instructors and by students.",

In this research commentary, we describe the intellectual origins and development of two major strands of inquiry in US higher education, offer an explanation for apparent differences in these strands, and argue that they be united under a common vision of Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education (IBME). Central to this common vision are four pillars of IBME: student engagement in meaningful mathematics, student collaboration for sensemaking, instructor inquiry into student thinking, and equitable instructional practice to include all in rigorous mathematical learning and mathematical identity-building. We conclude this commentary with a call for a four-pronged agenda for research and practice focused on learning trajectories, transferable skills, equity, and a systems approach.",

		"abstract": "This paper concerns “planes-coordination” and “long-term-prediction” difficulties. These are specifically the case when students attempt to visualize solution curves of autonomous differential equations for predicting the long-term behavior of various initial conditions. To address these issues, a study was conducted in which three different methods, namely Standard, Traditional, and Dynamic, were implemented in three different classrooms, to allow a comparison of these methods regarding their effectiveness to overcome these difficulties. Forty-eight students participated in the study and each class had four instructional sessions taken by the first author. Of the four sessions, the first two were the same for all three classes. Then a pre-test was administered 2 weeks after the second session. For the next two sessions, an educational intervention was implemented for the two experimental groups. A post-test was administered 3 weeks after the fourth session. Analysis of the data collected via pre- and post-tests revealed that a) both the Traditional and the Dynamic groups showed enhanced performance in the sample solution curve-drawing, and b) the Dynamic group displayed improvement in long-term prediction performance. The conclusion is that an educational intervention can have a positive impact on students’ advancement in this area. The concluding remark is that there might be a link between “planes-coordination” and “long-term-prediction” difficulties.",

		"abstract": "Students use a variety of resources to make sense of integration, and interpreting the definite integral as a sum of infinitesimal products (rooted in the concept of a Riemann sum) is particularly useful in many physical contexts. This study of beginning and upper-level undergraduate physics students examines some obstacles students encounter when trying to make sense of integration, as well as some discomfort and skepticism some students maintain even after constructing useful conceptions of the integral. In particular, many students attempt to explain what integration does by trying to use algebraic sense-making to interpret the symbolic manipulations involved in using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Consequently, students demonstrate a reluctance to use their understanding of “what a Riemann sum does” to interpret “what an integral does.” This research suggests an absence of instructional attention to subtle differences between sense-making in algebra and sense-making in calculus, perhaps inhibiting efforts to promote Riemann sum interpretations of the integral during calculus instruction.",

		"abstract": "This study is concerned with the reasoning that undergraduates apply when deciding whether a prompt is an example or non-example of the subspace concept. A qualitative analysis of written responses of 438 students revealed five unconventional tacit models that govern their reasoning. The models account for whether a prompt is a subset of a vector space, whether the zero vector is included, the structure of vectors, their number in the formula for the general solution to the system of linear equations, and the corresponding coefficient matrix. Furthermore, a conception was identified in students’ responses, according to which the algebraic structure of a vector space passes from a ‘parent’ space to its subset, turning automatically it into a subspace. For many students this conception of an inheriting structure was instrumental for identifying and reasoning around subspaces. Polysemy of the prefix ‘sub’ and students’ prior experiences in identifying concept examples are used for offering explanations for the emergence of the conception.",

		"abstract": "Facing increased pressure to improve retention and graduation rates, engineering departments are increasingly scrutinizing whether they are getting their desired outcomes from core mathematics coursework. Since mathematics courses are a significant source of attrition and many engineering faculty are unhappy with students’ mathematical abilities, more engineering departments are increasingly looking at drastic options of taking students out of mathematics courses and teaching students mathematics themselves. To mitigate this trend, it may be valuable to better understand what engineering faculty hope students learn from their mathematics coursework. When engineering faculty explain why they require these high-failure prerequisites, many claim that “mathematical maturity”, not calculus skill, is the desired outcome of completing the core math sequence of courses. To better understand what engineering faculty mean by “mathematical maturity”, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of how 27 engineering faculty members define “mathematical maturity”. We found that these engineering faculty believed that the mathematically mature student would have strong mathematical modeling skills supported by the ability to extract meaning from symbols and the ability to use computational tools as needed. Faculty frequently lamented that students had underdeveloped epistemic beliefs that undermined their modeling skills, thinking that mathematics is unrelated to the real world and has little practical value. They attributed these dysfunctional epistemic beliefs to their perception that mathematics is too often taught without genuine physical context and realistic examples. We suggest potential avenues for reform that will allow mathematics departments to better serve their client departments in engineering and thus retain control of their courses.",

This paper focuses on the efforts of one mathematics education reform movement in higher education to frame itself and its inquiry-based learning (IBL) teaching methods. Since its inception, members of this IBL movement struggled to negotiate their historical connection to the legacy of the late mathematician R. L. Moore and their need to modernize to recruit new mathematics instructors. A strong initial connection to Moore and his now-troubling racial and sexist views led to intense disputes over the framing, or branding, of the movement that at first inhibited its growth, but over time led to an understanding of IBL that embraces a broader range of methods and people.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate implementation of an early intervention mastery activity during the first two weeks of college algebra and precalculus courses at a large U.S. public university. Statistical modeling of (N = 935) students’ performance in the courses, including a logistic regression model of pass/fail course achievement with students’ high school rank, ACT Mathematics scores, and performance on the intervention as explanatory variables, suggested significant independent differences in course performance across performance levels on the early mastery activity. An evaluation of diagnostic validity for the model yielded a 19% false negative rate (predicted to fail the course, but passed) and a 7% false positive rate (students predicted to pass the course, but failed), suggesting the early mastery activity, when combined with admissions indicators of mathematics readiness, may be useful in better identifying students at risk of failing their first university mathematics course. This strategy, which also yields information for focused intervention efforts, is currently being explored through a campus-wide advising tool at the research site.",

		"abstract": "In this study, a description is provided for the development of two undergraduate students’ geometric reasoning about the derivative of a complex-valued function with the aid of Geometer’s Sketchpad (GSP) during an interview sequence designed to help them characterize the derivative geometrically. Specifically, a particular GSP task at the end of this interview sequence aided the participants in viewing the derivative as a local property. This advancement is notable as previous participants had been largely unable to make this characterization precisely, and the participants of this study only did so while working on the final task of the interview sequence. This task required students to determine an algebraic formula given only geometric data through GSP. Particularly, they recognized that their disks constructed in GSP needed to be small to accurately identify points where the function is non-differentiable, and to stay away from the “bad points” when determining differentiability.",

The study took place in a discourse-focused undergraduate mathematics classroom taught by an experienced instructor. Using the classroom observation tool EQUIP and social network surveys, we generated quantitative data on patterns of student participation in this classroom that were presented to the instructor at the end of the semester. Our analysis focuses on how the instructor made sense of these analytics and ultimately changed his teaching practices in a future semester. This paper provides insight into how three data sources can be triangulated—classroom participation, student experiences, and teacher perspective—to better understand discourse-based participation in undergraduate mathematics.

		"abstract": "Prior research acknowledges the need to further develop undergraduate mathematics instruction. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between instructional design and quality of learning. This quantitative study approaches the learning environment by comparing students’ approaches to learning, self-efficacy, and experiences of the teaching-learning environment in two undergraduate mathematics courses using different pedagogical approaches. The first course functioned within a traditional lecture-based framework with the inclusion of student-centred elements, and the second course was implemented with Extreme Apprenticeship, a novel student-centred teaching method. The analysis is based on the same cohort of students in these two contexts (N = 91). Students were clustered based on their deep and surface approaches to learning and three clusters were identified: students applying a deep approach, students applying a surface approach, and students applying a context-sensitive surface approach. The results show that the more student-centred course design succeeded in supporting more favourable approaches to learning, higher self-efficacy levels, and more positive experiences of the teaching-learning environment. In addition, all three clusters benefited from the more student-centred course design, with students applying a context-sensitive surface approach benefiting the most. Overall, the results suggest that it is possible to promote the quality of university mathematics learning with instructional designs that, besides content, take a holistic approach to the learning environment.",

The development of the IOIM was a multi-phase, iterative process that included reviewing K-16 research literature, analyzing videos of classroom instruction, and pilot testing. This process resulted in the identification of instructional practices that support the successful implementation of inquiry-oriented instruction (IOI) at the undergraduate level. These practices, which comprise the IOIM, provide an empirically grounded description of IOI. In addition, the IOIM provides a rubric for evaluating the degree to which an instructor’s classroom instruction is reflective of these practices. As a proof of concept for the IOIM, we present the results of a pilot test – in which data from a large professional development program designed to support undergraduate mathematics instructors in implementing inquiry-oriented instruction was scored using the IOIM.",

		"abstract": "In the transition from secondary to tertiary mathematics, students try to participate in tertiary mathematics by replicating familiar school mathematical discourses. The objective of this case study is to investigate the conditions and affordances under which students proceed from familiar school mathematical discourses to new, tertiary discourses with a specific perspective on learning processes. The study was located in an upper secondary transition course in a teaching unit on elementary number theory in which highly proficient students in their penultimate year of schooling participated. The main finding is that there was not a linear progression towards the intended tertiary mathematical discourse of modular multiplication but a coexistence of two discourses developing in parallel: the intended tertiary discourse and a continuation of school mathematical discourses. Students see these two discourses as the same, connected by the same perceived aim of searching for patterns. Further hindering discursive development are utterances, in which elements of the intended tertiary discourse (words and representations) are used superfluously, so that elementary/secondary utterances appear to be tertiary. These findings illustrate the need to explicate and address metanarratives. Metanarratives can connect two discourses developing in parallel in ways that, in this case, hinder discursive development towards the intended tertiary discourse.",

		"abstract": "At the University of Paderborn, the course “Introduction into the culture of mathematics” is required for all first-year students who enter the study program for future mathematics teachers at lower secondary level (grade 5–10). In this inquiry-based transition-to-proof course, we use four different kinds of proofs (the generic proof with numbers, the generic proof with figurate numbers, the proof with figurate numbers using geometric variables, and the so-called “formal proof”) to engage students in exploration, reasoning, and proving. In this paper, we report findings from an empirical study in winter term 2014/15 (pre- and posttest) concerning proof validation and acceptance. We used different kinds of ‘reasoning’ taken from Healy and Hoyles (2000) to assess students’ proof validation. At the beginning of the course, about a third of the students judged the purely empirical verifications and wrong algebraic operations as correct proof. These forms of reasoning being judged as correct proofs decreased greatly in the posttest. To investigate proof acceptance, the students had to rate different aspects – such as “conviction”, “explanatory power”, or “validity” - of the four kinds of proofs. “Proof acceptance scales” with very high reliabilities (Cronbach’s α> .864) were constructed using factor analysis. While in the pretest most of the students did not accept the generic proofs and the proof with geometric variables as general valid verifications, their acceptance increased during the course. However, in the posttest, the ratings of the different aspects vary greatly concerning the four kinds of proofs.",

These proofs are typically valid otherwise. However, such proofs are invalid because they would prove the false claim that commutativity is preserved by any homomorphism. This observation from practice raises researchable questions: How common is this phenomenon? What is the nature of this phenomenon and can we explain why students produce this type of argument? In this paper, we report a small-scale two-part survey study and a preliminary interview study designed to begin exploring these questions. Our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely quite common and goes beyond a simple omission of a proof detail. Drawing on the research literature and our follow-up interviews, we propose potential explanations for this phenomenon. Finally, we discuss two different ways to think about supporting students who make this error, one that focuses on refining the students’ proofs and one that involves encouraging students to use the conclusion of a statement to structure a proof.",

		"abstract": "The study reported here investigates the role, experiences and aspirations of a community of mathematics postgraduates as they learn to tutor in a mathematics support centre in a research-intensive university. This is achieved through in-depth interviews with nine postgraduate tutors all of whom had experience working in the centre. The data is analysed through the lens of communities of practice and presented through the voices of the postgraduates themselves. It sheds light on their personal trajectories as ‘newcomers’ to the peculiarities of tutoring within a mathematics support centre, and the ways in which they learn from, support and cooperate with each other in their common endeavour. As the postgraduates progress through their three or four years working in the centre the data reveals a growing confidence and, for some, a strong willingness to nurture and encourage their younger colleagues. Some of the ‘old timers’ go on to assist in the recruitment of new tutors and demonstrate insights into the ways their experience as tutors in the support centre will inform and influence their own future careers as academics. In particular, our work highlights the ways in which tutoring in the centre contributes to their own mathematical learning and personal development. The work is driven by a need to better understand the practices of postgraduate tutors in the growing field of university mathematics support and a desire to improve these. We consider how what we have learned can be put to use both in mathematics support centres and in university mathematics education more generally. By doing so we contribute to the solution of a widely reported ‘mathematics problem’ in higher education. At the same time this work strengthens what has been described as a ‘fragile’ relationship between mathematicians and educational researchers, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practice in a research-intensive university mathematics department.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents the development and validation of the 17-item mathematics Graduate Student Instructor Observation Protocol (GSIOP) at two universities. The development of this instrument attended to some unique needs of novice undergraduate mathematics instructors while building on an existing instrument that focused on classroom interactions particularly relevant for students’ development of conceptual understanding, called the Mathematical Classroom Observation Protocol for Practices (MCOP2). Instrument validation involved content input from mathematics education researchers and upper-level mathematics graduate student instructors at two universities, internal consistency analysis, interrater reliability analysis, and structure analyses via scree plot analysis and exploratory factor analysis. A Cronbach-Alpha level of 0.868 illustrated a viable level for internal consistency. Crosstabulation and correlations illustrate high level of interrater reliability for all but one item, and high levels across all subsections. Collaborating a scree plot with the exploratory factor analysis illustrated three critical groupings aligning with the factors from the MCOP2 (student engagement and teacher facilitation) while adding a third factor, lesson design practices. Taken collectively, these results indicate that the GSIOP measures the degree to which instructors’ and students’ actions in undergraduate mathematics classrooms align with practices recommended by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) using a three-factor structure of teacher facilitation, student engagement, and design practices.",

		"abstract": "College algebra has been noted as a critical course in post-secondary institutions because it serves as a gateway for major selection and college completion. Combinatorial topics like repeatable permutations are often overlooked in K-12 and undergraduate curricula. Likewise, students’ achievement and motivation are affected by the type of classroom climate created in the undergraduate mathematics classroom. Inquiry-based mathematical education (IBME) is a viable instructional approach because of its focus on community meaning-making of the mathematical content. However, lecture-style approaches still dominate post-secondary mathematics classrooms even though they have been criticized for their focus on procedural knowledge and disinviting environment. Therefore, the purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to test the effects of instructional approach (i.e., lecture-style vs. IBME) and social support (i.e., absence or presence) on undergraduate student motivation and achievement of combinatorial mathematics. Findings indicated that intentional social support-building – regardless of pedagogical method – had the strongest effects on students’ perceived autonomy-support, competence and achievement. Although no differing pedagogical effects were discovered (most likely due to the one-time implementation of the lesson formats), the findings provide evidence for the necessity of community-building efforts -- an aspect of education that is often overlooked in the undergraduate mathematics classroom.",

		"abstract": "In many countries STEM degree programs face high dropout rates, which are often attributed to insufficient mathematical preparation of incoming undergraduates. However, it is largely unclear which mathematical prerequisites universities expect from their new STEM undergraduates. There are hardly official documents and it is even an open question whether there is a consensus among university instructors. The main goal of this study is therefore to describe the expected mathematical prerequisites for new STEM undergraduates. We conducted a Delphi study with German university instructors for first semester mathematics courses in STEM programs. The participants identified 179 prerequisites addressing: (1) mathematical content, (2) mathematical processes, (3) views about the nature of mathematics, and (4) personal characteristics. For 140 of these prerequisites there was a consensus regarding their necessity among the university instructors. The expected mathematical prerequisites are mainly on a basic level and do not require formalistic or abstract mathematical knowledge or abilities.",

Understanding the nature and effects of this form of instruction is of growing importance due to the strength and breadth of the IBL movement and its connections to other forms of inquiry in undergraduate mathematics. In this case study of one real analysis course taught by a very experienced instructor and leader in the IBL community, we identify the primary goals this professor set forth for his students and the instructional strategies he employed to help them attain these goals. We observe that many of these practices seek to manage the double bind of proving in the classroom (Herbst Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 33(3), 176-203, 2002). Accordingly, we relate and categorize student storylines in the course according to their goal orientation and their level of buy-in to the IBL learning environment. We operationalize orientation and buy-in according to the double bind of the didactic contract by observing whether students focused more on the professor’s obligation to provide resources for students to successfully complete the work of the course (and earn good grades) or on his obligation to provide an authentic experience in mathematical proving. Students’ with different goal orientation and buy-in profiles took advantage of different aspects the professor’s instructional strategies to engage in the course in ways that were productive for them.",

The role of classroom approaches, teacher beliefs, and underlying student backgrounds have been studied in different ways. As a part of this effort researchers have studied the degree to which personality factors and affect contribute to (or mitigate) a student’s level of effective engagement. In this work we present the results from the first semester of a two-year study of the role of anxiety, personality factors and self-efficacy in student success and career planning for a cohort of students entering a developmental mathematics course at the university level. We quantify the impact of anxiety on success and grade outcomes, as well as identify a personality factor interacting with success in a surprising way. We provide initial data regarding the students’ sense of belonging in STEM disciplines and their self-efficacy levels, and then analyse their career planning patterns.",

		"abstract": "We engaged five mathematicians who conduct research in the domain of complex analysis or use significant tools from complex analysis in their research in interviews about basic concepts of differentiation and integration of complex functions. We placed a variety of constructivist, social-constructivist, and embodied theories in mathematics education in conversation with one another to explore the development of the expert participants’ construction of mathematical meanings while moving between varying levels of abstraction from embodied concepts and real-world contexts to symbolic manipulation and formal theories. The mathematicians relied heavily on direct application of concepts and analogies from differentiation of real-valued functions and employed rotation and dilation as a local linear description of the action of a complex differentiable function with attendant repeated mental imagery and physical gestures. They also employed reasoning about real-valued line integrals to interpret contour integrals but acknowledged significant struggle to conceptually interpret what was analogously accumulated in the complex case. Instead, they all developed more personal meanings through a process of reconciling various aspects across their concrete to formal domains of reasoning. Much of the observed construction of meaning was manifested through contextualizing well-understood aspects of formal mathematical theory. We consequently explore implications for characterizing mathematical conceptual development as an interplay between concrete and formal reasoning rather than a development from one to another.",

In an effort to better understand students’ reasoning about the MP, we had two undergraduate students reinvent a statement of the MP in a teaching experiment. In this paper, we adopt an actor-oriented perspective (Lobato, Educational Researcher, 32(1), 17–20, 2003, Educational Psychologist, 47(3), 1–16 2012) and draw on Lockwood’s, Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 32, 251–265 (2013) model of students’ combinatorial thinking to trace the students’ development of a certain conception about order – that a statement of the MP should allow for any ordering of the stages of a counting process. Notably, this conception differs from how order is treated in textbook statements of the MP. We report on how this conception persisted for the students, and we explain how the researchers (interviewers) and students managed to proceed through the teaching experiment while maintaining different conceptions of order. The students’ reasoning about order sheds light on ways in which students may think about order and highlights potential subtleties about multiplication in counting that deserve attention.",

This paper reports a study investigating whether there is indeed such a relationship. First and second year mathematics undergraduate students at two universities in the UK were invited to complete a questionnaire, comprising the Assessment Preference Inventory and the Mathematics-Related Beliefs Questionnaire. The results did not support the prediction, with the only statistically significant relation found being one between students’ self-efficacy and their preference for summative assessment methods requiring complex responses. We conclude either that the prediction of the relationship is mistaken, or that concerns about the definition of discipline-based epistemological beliefs, the uniformity of the sample in the study or the issue of validity of the tools used to measure epistemological beliefs may mask the nature of this relationship.",

On a more theoretical level, the teaching project was developed in the framework of didactic engineering, and provides opportunities to contribute to the ongoing work on its adaptation to the specific context of tertiary education. In the a priori analysis, we highlight the didactical potential of tasks of differentiation between neighboring concepts as a pathway to advanced mathematical concepts.

This paper focuses on themes emerging from a larger project that investigated how students understand and use mathematics in chemical kinetics, a field of study concerned with monitoring the rate of chemical reactions. The primary data source for this study involved a subset of the data from the larger project, focusing on semi-structured interviews with 40 students sampled from a second-semester general chemistry course. During the interviews students were asked to work through chemical kinetics problems that could be solved without calculations (using relationships between quantities and chemistry principles) or they could be solved algorithmically (using equations and the provided data). The interviews were analyzed using the construct of epistemic games, which describe a collection of resources and an associated structure that define and guide problem-solving and reflect epistemological commitments. Findings indicate students have productive resources and approaches for engaging in problem-solving, reflected by the observed shared set of epistemic games. Implications emphasize the role of scaffolding and explicit questioning to prevent compartmentalization of chemistry and mathematics, suggesting the need for more support to help students productively apply the knowledge and skills learned in mathematics courses to contexts such as chemistry.",

		"abstract": "Most prospective secondary mathematics teachers in the United States complete a course in real analysis, yet view the content as unrelated to their future teaching. We leveraged a theoretically-motivated instructional model to design modules for a real analysis course that could inform secondary teachers’ actionable content knowledge and pedagogy. The theoretical model and designed curriculum launches the study of advanced mathematics content, in this case, real analysis, via authentic 7–12 classroom situations, abstracts the secondary mathematics, and uses that content to motivate the presentation of the advanced mathematics content. Subsequently, the curriculum then reconnects to practice, asking the teachers to translate ideas from real analysis in ways that are appropriate for teaching high school content to students. This study evaluated the success of the curriculum in terms of the students’ proficiency with real analysis, challenging secondary mathematics content, and the use of that content in teaching situations via both written post-tests and interviews and showed the viability of the model and experimental curriculum.",

		"abstract": "When solving counting problems, students often struggle with determining what they are trying to count (and thus what problem type they are trying to solve and, ultimately, what formula appropriately applies). There is a need to explore potential interventions to deepen students’ understanding of key distinctions between problem types and to differentiate meaningfully between such problems. In this paper, we investigate undergraduate students’ understanding of sets of outcomes in the context of elementary Python computer programming. We show that four straightforward program conditional statements seemed to reinforce important conceptual understandings of four canonical combinatorial problem types. We also suggest that the findings in this paper represent one example of a way in which a computational setting may facilitate mathematical learning.",

		"abstract": "This study compares the relative influence of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in university students’ interpretation of multiply quantified statements in mathematics, both before and after instruction. Like previous studies, results show that semantics plays a heavy role in student interpretation, especially before instruction. Unlike previous studies, our data suggests that the patterns of student interpretation rely more upon the mathematical context than upon the order of the quantifiers. We operationalize two of Grice’s (1975) pragmatic Maxims to evaluate whether they help explain which interpretations are harder for students to adopt for various statements. Our data support the claim that students find it easier to construct relevant interpretations, but do not support the claim that students find it easier to construct interpretations that render the statement true. Finally, based on our sample from six Transition to Proof classes across the US, we observe that after their experiences in such courses students became more sensitive to syntax in their interpretation of the statements.",

While the RMARS and other standard instruments measure students’ anxiety in response to computation, test situations, and math course activities such as buying a textbook or watching a lecture, the new items present scenarios that reflect current pedagogical recommendations for college mathematics classrooms, specifically solving of non-routine problems and explaining thinking to peers. Anxiety in response to these kinds of scenarios we name Problem Solving Anxiety and Explanation Anxiety, respectively. With a survey sample of 132 future teachers enrolled at colleges and universities, we use exploratory factor analyses to demonstrate distinctness of these constructs from existing constructs and provide evidence for construct validity.

Exploiting the potential of digital technology, these Internet-based environments administer computer-generated homework, assistance and feedback for students. This article presents a case-study of a small group of ִundergraduate engineering students’ learning activity in mathematics in an online environment. The study focuses on students’ interactions with the online environment to make sense of the affordances of this environment. Utilizing multiple sources of data aid in analyzing the intentional and the operational aspects of students’ interactions with several resources in this environment. With regard to both of these aspects, the affordances are thus viewed as features of the environment which support students’ engagement with the mathematical tasks. The analyses show that the students incorporated several online resources for solving the tasks posed in the automated system. Students met requirements of final answers in the automated system through varying sequences of mathematical operations for the posed tasks. The conditions of the automated system as well as the rules of the collective activity system played a role in students’ interactions with the mathematical tasks.",

In this paper, we explore the effects on student performance of the use of a computer software program to supplement instruction in an entry-level mathematics course at the undergraduate level, specifically, a pre-calculus course. Relying on data from multiple sections of the course over various semesters, we compare student performance in those classes utilizing the software against those in which it was not used.

		"abstract": "Individual mathematics teachers may value different aspects of teaching and learning mathematics, but at the same time their value systems are under the influence of socially shared values. This paper describes such values in Japanese mathematics education from a historical and normative perspective. After the introduction of Western mathematics into the modern school system in the Meiji period (1868-1912), the people of Japan struggled to adapt and absorb it onto the foundation of Japanese tradition. In the subsequent development of Japanese mathematics education, the integration of both practical and theoretical aspects have been issues, alongside changes in educational focus and in society at large, which are symbolically represented by the enrolment rates at all of elementary, secondary, and tertiary education levels. Mathematics education in Japan has also been subject to international influences, such as the reform movement and the modernization movement, at critical junctures in its development. Key concepts such as mathematical ideas, mathematical thinking, and mathematical activities are traces of such historical efforts by the Japanese mathematics education community, and represent their socially shared values.

Data were collected through pre- and post-tests. The results of the study show that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the control group students on the post-test. The intervention group students also showed significant increase in their test scores between pre- and post-test. While at least 80 % of the students in the intervention group abandoned their initial ideas on all of the 17 alternative conceptions that were identified by the authors but one, the percent of student abandoning their initial ideas in the control group was less than 50. The discussion focuses on the implications of these results for addressing students' alternative conceptions, promoting the argumentation-pedagogy in college science courses and the challenges associated with the use of argumentation in college science classrooms. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "An important goal in school mathematics is for students to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted conceptualization of function. Yet studies have found that undergraduate students often hold limited concept images for function. This study investigated 240 middle and upper secondary (15- to 18-year-old) students’ conceptualizations of function at different year levels (Years 9 to 12) to consider their conceptualizations relative to certain prior learning, as theorized by an epistemological model for concept development in mathematics. In this article we draw on data from students and their teachers in three Western national curriculum contexts (Israeli, English, and Australian) to explore possible relationships among students’ exposure to the word ‘function’, familiarity with different examples of functions, and their conceptualizations of function. Eighty high-achieving students from each context, 20 per year level, were prompted to respond to several fictitious students’ views on what a function is, and then to provide their own definition. The students’ responses were analyzed for evidence of a dominant meaning and any contributing ideas, as well as the use of any specific examples or non-examples of function to illustrate or clarify their views. Twenty teachers also participated in the study. Analysis of curriculum content and the teachers’ perspectives on their students led to our search for possible reasons for similarities and differences found among the responses. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we report a teaching experiment regarding the theory of polynomial approximations at the university mathematics teaching in Sweden. The experiment was designed by applying Variation theory and by using the free dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra. The aim of this study was to investigate if the technology-assisted teaching of Taylor polynomials compared with traditional way of work at the university level can support the teaching and learning of mathematical concepts and ideas. An engineering student group (n = 19) was taught Taylor polynomials with the assistance of GeoGebra while a control group (n = 18) was taught in a traditional way. The data were gathered by video recording of the lectures, by doing a post-test concerning Taylor polynomials in both groups and by giving one question regarding Taylor polynomials at the final exam for the course in Real Analysis in one variable. In the analysis of the lectures, we found Variation theory combined with GeoGebra to be a potentially powerful tool for revealing some critical aspects of Taylor Polynomials. Furthermore, the research results indicated that applying Variation theory, when planning the technology-assisted teaching, supported and enriched students’ learning opportunities in the study group compared with the control group. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

However, our main conclusions relate to a decline in the study of all sciences, rather than just mathematics. The reason that we have to consider all sciences is because of the difficulty in getting accurate figures for mathematical enrolments at the university level. We do, however, have accurate figures for high school level mathematics enrolments. We consider the reasons for this downturn in enrolments, which appear to be largely political and social. It is also noted that there have been declines in the numbers of students in areas other than science. Finally, we show that for French tertiary students, well-paid secure jobs are at least as important as subject choice. This is dramatically illustrated by the numbers of applicants applying for competitive positions as secondary teachers.",

The main purpose of this study was to explore how classroom response systems (CRS) could help impact the quality of written analysis papers submitted for this assignment by students taking 100-level biology courses at a medium-sized suburban, two-year college in the northeastern United States. Students in all participating course sections received written instructions on five key elements of critical analysis (CA) to include in scientific study analysis papers. Classroom instruction on recognizing these key elements in primary research papers was provided either via CRS or via an instructor-facilitated classroom discussion enhanced by the same PowerPoint presentation. A rubric, designed specifically for this assignment, was validated prior to its use in this study. Fifty students participated in the study, and those who received the CRS intervention achieved significantly higher CA scores for identifying implications of study findings, while the group that received only written instructions achieved significantly higher CA scores for discussing the credibility of the references used by the authors in planning the critiqued study. The implications of this study are discussed along with ideas for future research.",

		"abstract": "This article describes how creating a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) about ratio and proportion in a collaborative, technological environment during mathematics teacher training, benefited the development of content, pedagogical and technological knowledge for teaching. Twenty-nine trainee mathematics teachers, divided into groups, created teaching units as part of a MOOC in the subject of ratio and proportion. Before MOOC creation, the trainee teachers held misconceptions about the meaning of ratio and proportion, but through a process of reflective thinking, collaboration and peer assessment, they developed a sequence of teaching units about different aspects of the subject. This process allowed them to acquire a broad perspective on the subject, develop their Specialized Content Knowledge (SCK) [Ball, D. L., Thames, M. H., & Phelps, G. (2008). Content knowledge for teaching. What makes it special? Journal of Teacher Education, 59(5), 389–407] and let go of their own misconceptions. The trainee teachers also integrated into their units realistic situations of ratio and proportion, facilitating involvement and understanding, hence MOOC development also promoted Knowledge of Content and Teaching (KCT) [Ball, D. L., Thames, M. H., & Phelps, G. (2008). Content knowledge for teaching. What makes it special? Journal of Teacher Education, 59(5), 389–407]. Lastly, the need to select and adapt computerized tools to meet teaching objectives, promoted Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) [Mishra, P., & Koehler, M. J. (2006). Technological Pedagogical content knowledge: A framework for teacher knowledge. Teachers College Record, 108(6), 1017–1054].

		"abstract": "Given the prevalence of research in undergraduate mathematics education focused on student reasoning and the development of instructional innovations that leverage student reasoning, it is important to understand the ways undergraduate mathematics instructors make sense of these innovations. We characterize pedagogical reasoning about inquiry-oriented instruction relative to vertices of the instructional triangle (content, students, and instructor). Through this lens, we analyze conversations of twenty-five mathematicians who elected to attend a workshop on inquiry-oriented instruction at a large national mathematics conference. Identifying differences in talk between two breakout groups, we argue that deeper mathematical engagement in task sequences designed for students supported deeper engagement in students’ mathematical reasoning and engendered reasoning about instruction that was more frequently accompanied by rationale based in mathematics or students’ reasoning about mathematics. Importantly, deeper mathematical engagement was observed when the discussion facilitator prompted participants to engage through a mathematical lens rather than an instructional lens. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

		"abstract": "• Instructors built on student ideas more with experience. • Students contributed more when the instructor pursued their uncertainty. • Instructors can learn by implementing inquiry-oriented instructional materials. • Increased pedagogical content knowledge can support improved teacher scaffolding. • Instructor goals may shift as their pedagogical content knowledge increases. Considerable learning is entailed in adopting an inquiry-oriented approach to teaching an undergraduate mathematics class. In this analysis, we examine classroom video data of three instructors' initial implementation of an inquiry-oriented instructional unit and their implementation of the same unit one year later. We document consistent increases in instances of eliciting and building on student contributions across tasks and instructors. We then leverage Toulmin's argumentation scheme to analyze how classroom discussions became more mathematically robust and student-centered from initial to subsequent implementations. We examine how social and analytic scaffolding provided by the instructor relate to shifts in argumentation. In particular, we posit that shifts in one instructor's framing of mathematical discussion and coordination of social and analytic scaffolding fostered an increase in student contributions to mathematical arguments. Implications for instructor knowledge and learning are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "First-year undergraduates may be particularly prone to experiencing difficulties with facilitating feelings of relatedness, due to the recent shift in educational environments (i.e. from high school to university), which may be unfamiliar. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine whether the implementation of a single pedagogical strategy, centred within the self-determination theory framework, could effectively address students’ innate need for relatedness. Specifically, informal verbal feedback was utilized to enhance teacher–student communication, where the teacher spoke with each undergraduate student individually at the start of every lesson for 1–2 minutes. A total of 243 Advanced Science undergraduates enrolled in the first-year course at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, were included in the study. Seventy-one undergraduates were enrolled in 2016, whereas 172 undergraduates were enrolled in 2017. A mixed research methodology was employed to best leverage the utility of both qualitative and quantitative data. Interestingly, the use of informal verbal feedback as a pedagogical strategy significantly improved the student’ perceptions of receiving helpful feedback to aid their learning. These findings are important as they emphasize the utility and effectiveness of implementing one new pedagogical strategy to facilitate student’ motivation, by enhancing feelings of relatedness. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "International comparative studies of education have shown that the increase in mathematical attainment differs significantly among students in relation to the different school types in which their mathematical foundations were acquired. In tertiary education, the same differences are observed with respect to simple tasks that relate to the subject matter of secondary education. Therefore, we investigate the question of whether this observation holds equally for concept construction in the field of eigen theory, by applying Dubinsky's action, process, object, schema (APOS) theory, and Tall's worlds of mathematics. We focus on eigen theory because we regard it as particularly representative of linear algebra in terms of its expressibility in the embodied and symbolic worlds. In our empirical study, we investigated concept constructions as correlates of educational trajectories of 36 students who covered the entire course program of a first semester mathematics course for first-year engineering students. Although significant differences in procedural knowledge were observed, results indicate that the type of secondary school does not affect concept construction among students who complete the entire course program. In our final discussion, we present implications for teaching and learning of linear algebra in heterogeneous classes and the integration of deeper learning methods into the course design.

Our study incorporated a mixed-method approach that involved surveys (to assess students' perceptions of the learning environment and attitudes towards mathematics), interviews, observations of classes and narrative stories. A sample of 90 students from 3 tertiary-level institutions in Abu Dhabi participated in the study. In-depth qualitative data provided information about the introduction and use of games in mathematics. A narrative, based on classroom observations of students playing Jeopardy!-type mathematics games, provided insights into games in action in the classrooms. The data were analysed to examine students' interactions during the games and to triangulate, clarify and explain students' responses to the learning environment and attitude questionnaires. To examine pre-post differences in students perceptions of the learning environment and their attitudes, 2 questionnaires were administered to students before and after the introduction of games. Pre-post differences for 3 of the 6 learning environment scales (Teacher Support, Involvement, Personal Relevance) and both attitude scales (Enjoyment of Mathematics Lessons and Academic Efficacy scales) were statistically significant.

Although the preservice teacher was a strong undergraduate mathematics student, she used compensation \"moves\" to deflect attention away from her insecurities about her conceptual understanding of secondary mathematics. She feared being labeled as \"dumb\" and redirected conversations in order to protect her identity as a knower of mathematics. This paper investigates the culture in which preservice teachers develop confidence in their personal mathematics knowledge and how that confidence may influence behavior.",

		"abstract": "We outline the rationale, put forward by those concerned with software engineering, for adopting a formal methods approach to programming. An empirical study was undertaken with second and third year computer science undergraduates at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London. Students were invited to analyse retrospectively the difficulties which they perceived they encountered in learning formal reasoning methods. We present the results of the study and consider the pedagogical implications of students' perceptions of formal reasoning methods as reflected in those results. We note the problem that can arise caused by the sometimes conflicting expectations of computer science students first encountering a formal reasoning approach to programming and those engaged in teaching the principles involved. We conclude by indicating the steps which we are currently taking in order to address the issue of mismatched expectations and to overcome the difficulties reported by those students interviewed. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Previous research has investigated the representational translation practices of high school students, high school teachers, and college preservice teachers in various mathematical contexts including linear functions. Findings from qualitative research has frequently led to new notions about participant work and understanding. Many quantitative research has investigated the degree to which some in these populations correctly perform these translations. However, it seems that only infrequently have empirical research investigated findings from qualitative studies and vice versa, and findings regarding one population are rarely compared with findings of another population. This study (a) empirically explores the frequency of success of preservice teachers (N = 80) regarding representational translations in the context of linear functions, (b) quantifies results from previous qualitative, literature-based research regarding high school students and teachers, and (c) quantitatively compares the results. This study demonstrates that some mathematical representational translations are more difficult than others. © 2019 School Science and Mathematics Association",

Several studies have explored the interaction between the use of technology and student learning of calculus. Our study seeks to build on this work by exploring the understanding of basic calculus concepts by students who are studying calculus in a graphics calculator-based environment. In particular, the purpose of the study is to developed descriptions of calculus students' understandings of function and limit, to explore the interrelationships among their understandings of these conceptual areas, and to identify instances where there is evidence that the students' understanding seems to have been influenced by the availability of the technology. Data for the study was collected through a series of clinical interviews with a small group of students enrolled in a first semester college calculus course and an advanced placement high school calculus course. The data was used to build descriptions of the students' understanding and the role the graphing technology might play in that development. Implications of these findings for calculus curriculum and instruction are presented. © 1994.",

		"abstract": "The research reported in this paper explores the nature of student knowledge about group theory, and how an individual may develop an understanding of certain topics in this domain. As part of a long-term research and development project in learning and teaching undergraduate mathematics, this report is one of a series of papers on the abstract algebra component of that project. The observations discussed here were collected during a six-week summer workshop where 24 high school teachers took a course in Abstract Algebra as part of their work. By comparing written samples, and student interviews with our own theoretical analysis, we attempt to describe ways in which these individuals seemed to be approaching the concepts of group, subgroup, coset, normality, and quotient group. The general pattern of learning that we infer here illustrates an action-process-object-schema framework for addressing these specific group theory issues. We make here only some quite general observations about learning these specific topics, the complex nature of \"understanding\", and the role of errors and misconceptions in light of an action-process-schema framework. Seen as research questions for further exploration, we expect these observations to inform our continuing investigations and those of other researchers. We end the paper with a brief discussion of some pedagogical suggestions arising out of our considerations. We defer, however, a full consideration of instructional strategies and their effects on learning these topics to some future time when more extensive research can provide a more solid foundation for the design of specific pedagogies. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

Against this background, an interplay between the power of a modern tool of technology and educational constraints it presents is discussed. Using topics from algebra (equations) and elementary number theory (summation of powers of integers), the paper suggests ways of developing problems that are both technology-immune and technology-enabled in the sense that whereas software can facilitate problem solving, its direct application is not sufficient for finding an answer.

On the basis of data gathered from clinical interviews with 32 students in their first abstract algebra course, we consider the tasks of listing the elements of the dihedral group D4 and finding the product of two such elements. These problems can be solved either using a \"visual\" approach of transforming a square or an \"analytic\" approach of multiplying permutations. Rather than clearly preferring either a visual or analytic strategy, most students in our study used some combination of these approaches. Our results suggest that the conventional analyzer/visualizer dichotomy may not be an appropriate classification scheme for describing learning processes or for designing instruction. We propose an alternative model, the Visualizer/Analyzer or VA model, that assumes visualization and analysis to be mutually dependent in mathematical problem solving, rather than unrelated opposites. Our model provides one description of how this mutual dependence might function. We end by considering how pedagogical approaches might be designed in consonance with this model to help students coordinate visual and analytic thinking.",

		"abstract": "The existence of probability misconceptions at the college level and their resistance to change has been well-documented in previous research. Analogical reasoning has been successfully utilized by John Clement and associates in overcoming physics misconceptions by basing the knowledge reconstruction process on problems which draw out students' beliefs which are in agreement with accepted theory. Such problems are referred to as anchoring situations. A similar approach was attempted in this study in the area of probability. Anchoring situations conceptually analogous to misconception-prone/target probability situations were generated. The target situations were placed in Version A of the WDYTTCA (What Do You Think The Chances Are?) instrument and the analogous anchoring situations were placed in Version B. The instrument was given to 24 secondary mathematics student teachers. Version A revealed that probability misconceptions were common whereas Version B showed that anchors for overcoming these misconceptions could be generated. Follow-up interviews with 15 volunteers indicated that the anchoring situations could be effectively utilized in overcoming probability misconceptions when the participants were engaged in a process of analogical reasoning.",

		"abstract": "The general opinion of university lecturers is that standards in mathematics have fallen substantially over recent years. There is, however, very little empirical evidence in support of this allegation. A national survey was carried out to determine the extent and scope of attitudes within universities concerned with teaching engineering degree courses and the perceptions of undergraduate students. Anecdotal evidence, gained from interviews with university engineering lecturers, supports the theory that the problem originates from the National Curriculum. This in turn adversely affects the starting level of mathematics A levels and engineering degree courses. The overriding opinion therefore assumes that it is not the students who are failing the system but rather it is the system which is failing the students. The survey also illustrated the lack of communication between educational institutions. A level, BTEC/GNVQ, foundation and degree courses are all independently written and moderated. The resultant curriculum material is, however, not always freely available. Even in cases where syllabuses are widely publicized the information does not appear to be employed in the enhancement of the continuity of engineering students’ education. As a consequence students experience a very disjointed mathematical education. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The finite element method is a very versatile and powerful technique for solving problems in engineering and the sciences and as such features in many advanced undergraduate courses in numerical methods. Over some twenty years of teaching the method on courses at that level the author has consistently experienced the same difficulty in each presentation of the course. The difficulty is that in order to solve even very simple problems a computational approach is needed. Students frequently find that they get bogged down in the complexities of a specific programming language and lose sight of the finite element method itself. The use of a spreadsheet, however, has made the teaching and learning of the method considerably easier. The interpretative nature of the environment, together with the straightforward method of placing formulae in cells, allows students to implement the method for problems of moderate size in a manner which is much quicker than was the case with a conventional programming language. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "In the development of innovative programmes to enhance the application skills of students a neglected population tends to be those students who have difficulty in addressing quite basic problems, but whose educational setting is prescribed by school policies such that more innovative teaching and learning environments are not available to them. This research sets out to develop a diagnostic framework that supports teaching and learning in such situations. Based on empirical research studies and on theoretical constructs of human learning a script analysis framework was developed encompassing criteria across categories of planning, monitoring, heuristic strategies, verification, knowledge resources, and beliefs. The framework represents a synthesis and extension of previous work. Two teachers worked with 47 students throughout a year in a senior secondary mathematics course geared to students intending to study mathematics at tertiary level. Data collection was limited to the type of information available to teachers working under restrictive policies—written protocols of student problems solving together with student comments on their own problem solving processes. Characteristic patterns were identified, confirmed, and used to generate a response quality hierachy within the framework. The resulting structure contained 23 cells and fulfils three purposes: 1. as a self-assessment aid to assist students to evaluate and enhance their application skills; 2. as a format for the provision of detailed formative feedback by teachers; 3. as a set of explicit targets for achieving summative quality in mathematical applications. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Effective mathematics teaching involves more than the teaching of mathematical concepts and procedures: it also includes helping students develop their dispositions towards mathematics. An important component in the reform of the programme at the authors' university was an understanding of students' dispositions and attitudes towards mathematics. This study focused on beliefs and attitudes of students at the college level. Students in a variety of mathematics courses were surveyed. Several variables, such as academic major, mathematical background and gender were used to classify the students who were surveyed.

Belief-scale scores indicated that significant changes in their beliefs and perceptions about mathematics instruction occurred across the 2-year sequence of professional course work and student teaching during their undergraduate program but that their use of knowledge of children's mathematical thinking during instructional planning and teaching was limited.

		"abstract": "Concerns with the ability of U.S. classrooms to develop learners who will become the next generation of innovators, particularly given the present climate of standardized testing, warrants a closer look at creativity in science classrooms. The present study explored these concerns associated with teachers' classroom practice by addressing the following research question: What pedagogical factors, and related teacher conceptions, are potentially related to the demonstration of creativity among science students? Seventeen middle-level, high school, and introductory-level college science teachers from a variety of school contexts participated in the study. A questionnaire developed for this study, interviews, and classroom observations were used in order to explore potential areas of relatedness between pedagogical factors and manifestations of student creativity in science. Five categories ultimately emerged and described potential areas in which teachers would have to explicitly plan for creativity. These areas could inform the pedagogical considerations that teachers would have to make within their lesson plans and activities in order to support its manifestation among students. These provide a starting point for science teachers and science teacher educators to consider how to develop supportive environments for student creative thinking.",

We found that there exists a gender bias with prospective teachers expecting girls to have negative attitudes toward mathematics and boys more likely to have positive attitudes toward mathematics. We found that these expectations exist for both prospective teachers in a traditional undergraduate degree program and prospective teachers in an alternative licensure graduate degree program. We also found that these expectations do change with the completion of a mathematics methods course and classroom experiences.",

		"abstract": "Rural schools face challenges that are often different than nonrural schools. Resource constraints are particularly acute in rural schools, and they struggle to offer advanced courses and extracurricular programs. The purpose of this paper is to present a descriptive, instrumental case study of an inclusive rural science, technology, engineering, and mathematics school that has successfully dealt with challenges and offers an innovative and productive learning environment, despite limited resources. For this study, a variety of on-site and off-site data collection techniques were used such as focus groups, classroom observation protocols, and surveys. Wayne School of Engineering (WSE) overcomes resource barriers by matching their schedule to the local community college, upgrading the rigor of their high school classes and facilitating student transition to college. WSE also requires extracurricular research projects that help students see the relevance of their in class learning, build 21st century skills, and connect to partners outside of the school. Faced with limited budgetary, technological, and logistical resources, WSE administrators, teachers, and students work collectively to overcome these barriers and provide high-quality education by finding ways to blur the lines of traditional secondary schools.",

		"abstract": "Students learn norms of proving by observing teachers generating proofs, engaging in proving, and generalizing features of proofs deemed convincing by an authority, such as a textbook. Students at all grade levels have difficulties generating valid proof; however, little research exists on students' understandings about what makes a mathematical argument convincing prior to more formal instruction in methods of proof. This study investigated middle-school students' (ages 12-14) evaluations of arguments for a statement in number theory. Students evaluated both an empirical and a general argument in an interview setting. The results show that students tend to prefer empirical arguments because examples enhance an argument's power to show that the statement is true. However, interview responses also reveal that a significant number of students find arguments to be most convincing when examples are supported with an explanation that \"tells why\" the statement is true. The analysis also examined the alignment of students' reasons for choosing arguments as more convincing along with the strategies they employ to make arguments more convincing. Overall, the findings show middle-school students' conceptions about what makes arguments convincing are more sophisticated than their performance in generating arguments suggests.",

This paper investigates the variability in the content of lectures by different university mathematics instructors teaching concurrently in the same course. The instructors enacted a shared lesson-plan and coordinated their teaching to ensure students in different sections of the course will receive equivalent academic preparation. However, classroom observations and interviews with the instructors indicate that while explicitly discussing the same definitions and theorems and working out similar examples, the instructors were implicitly trying to convey different informal content. An analysis of the instructors' mathematical discourse during the lectures and the interviews reveals that the instructors coordinated with each other content corresponding with object-level learning, while implicitly orienting their lectures towards fostering meta-level learning. This found gap highlights miscommunication between the instructors and points to the need of a shared and explicit discourse on meta-level learning at the collegiate level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

First year undergraduate students (13 from Cyprus and 14 from England) from a well-regarded university in each country were qualitatively interviewed at the commencement of their respective teacher education programmes. Data, which were analysed by means of a combination of theory- and data-driven coding, indicated that, in both countries, students entered university with beliefs about problems and problem-solving that were not only products of the cultures in which they were educated, but also frequently incommensurate with the problem-solving expectation of the curricular frameworks within which they would have to work as teachers. Also, the outcomes confirmed that, despite researchers’ assumptions of definitional convergence, the expressions ‘mathematical problem’ and ‘problem-solving’ continue to be used differently across cultures. Some implications for teacher education are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the nature of global argumentation structures of prospective middle school mathematics teachers in a technology enhanced environment. A qualitative case study was conducted with 8 participants from an Elementary Mathematics Education undergraduate program of one of the public universities in Ankara. Two implementations, 1 of which included 2 geometry tasks on triangles and another which included 2 geometry tasks based on circles, were conducted. Subsequently, global argumentation structures were revealed via data analysis. The findings indicated that the prospective middle school mathematics teachers resort frequently to simple global argumentation structures since their mathematical reasoning was insufficient. On the other hand, technology had a positive impact on argument construction and global argumentation structures of prospective middle school mathematics teachers. However, it was deduced that prospective middle school mathematics teachers need to be challenged on argumentation and about how to facilitate argumentation effectively in their future classroom experiences.",

		"abstract": "The ability to reason inferentially is increasingly important in today's society. It is hypothesized here that engaging primary school students in informal statistical reasoning (ISI), defined as making generalizations without the use of formal statistical tests, will help them acquire the foundations for inferential and statistical thinking. Teachers who engage students in ISI need to have good content knowledge of ISI (ISI-CK). However, little is known about the ISI-CK of primary education pre-service teachers. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe this knowledge by surveying 722 first-year pre-service teachers from seven teacher colleges across the Netherlands. The survey consisted of five tasks using open-ended questions and true/false statements. The descriptive analysis showed that most respondents understood that descriptive statistics that take the global shape of the distribution into account can be used as arguments within ISI. Although a majority agreed that random sampling is a valid sampling method, distributed sampling was the preferred strategy for selecting a sample. Moreover, when asked to make a generalization beyond the data, most pre-service teachers only described the data and did not appear to understand that a representative sample can be used to make inferences about a population. These findings suggest that it may be useful if statistics education for pre-service teachers places more emphasis on sampling and inference, thereby prompting pre-service teachers to engage in ISI.",

Due to space limitations, the university offered sections of both CAS and traditional simultaneously and, upon registration, stu-dents were given no indication as to which method of instruc-tion they were going to receive. All sections covered the same concepts and a common final exam was given. We compare the final grades of students enrolled in the computer-assisted and traditional sections over three consecutive semesters. The success and failure rates between the computer-assisted and traditional sections were equivocal, but the success rates were consistently higher in the computer-assisted sections.

		"abstract": "A classical dilemma faces any secondary science teacher: to teach to a standardised exam at the expense of student interest and exploration or to allow for individual discovery and creativity knowing full well that university entrance exam scores may suffer in the interim. When one considers that the half-life of a college graduate engineer is now estimated to be four years, the age of life-long learning certainly has arrived (Davis, 1996). Thus, the foremost role of a teacher today should be to teach students how to learn. In that regard, there has probably never been a piece of technology more fittingly applicable to this constructivist philosophy of education. Early on teachers learn that the effectiveness of web browser tools such as Mosaic, Internet Explorer, or Netscape must by necessity be built on constructivist orientations to teaching and learning (Collier & Le Baron, 1995). More and more, the responsibility for learning shifts to the learner who turns to technology for content, freeing the teacher to focus on the process of learning and interpersonal relationships (Davis & Botkin, 1994). This explosion of technology requires that students become active learners, that classroom teachers become co-learners (Loader, 1991). This study looked at the impact of a particular piece of technology that has exploded on the secondary school scene in the short span during the 1990s, the Internet used with both e-mail and World Wide Web (WWW or Web) browser software. In particular, the extent and nature of Internet usage and its impact on the constructivist learning environment was investigated. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

		"abstract": "With computer-based instruction, numerical data collection and analysis are performed effortlessly in the laboratory, simulations with idealized conditions are a click away, and abstract concepts that are difficult to visualize are represented in full-color animated displays. Many of these computer applications are designed to help students understand physics by clearly presenting the outcomes of physics or by making it easier to do scientific experiments. However, in the effort to get to the product of science, is there a danger of misrepresenting the process of science? This is a particularly important question in college science classes for future teachers where we try to model instructional practices that promote inquiry and active learning. If we want students to take responsibility for building their own understanding of science, they need to develop an understanding of what science is. In this study, we look at pre-service teacher classes in physics, one of which uses computer-based laboratories extensively. The context presented is one-dimensional motion, which is covered in the computer-based class with motion sensors interfaced to computers. We consider student performance in an interview setting and on an examination problem. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

CAS was initially used as an assistant for doing mathematics, enabling students to solve difficult problems. During the period of the study it came to be used as an assistant for learning mathematics, as a partner in the teaching and learning process. This article notes the changes required in organisation, teaching materials, and assessment, then reflects on changes in students' attitudes and learning outcomes. Surveys, interviews and teacher observations suggested that students' attitudes toward the use of CAS for learning mathematics were positive and that they believed that it aided their understanding. Students appreciated the availability of CAS for examinations. There was no demonstrable change in student achievement resulting from the changed pedagogical use of CAS. However changes in learning goals and assessment procedures mean that no simple comparison is possible. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

The activities are at a level appropriate for high school students and in certain cases, for undergraduate students taking introductory courses. Students will find the programs easy to reproduce and change, making them very useful for exploring basic probability ideas and for exploring other mathematical relationships.

Participants were 79 undergraduate pre-service teachers who were enrolled in the general education program and the teacher education program where the former offered a content course and the latter the methods course. Data were collected from students' paper-based survey responses. Quantitative analysis was utilized to analyze the collected data. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in content knowledge for algebra between the pre-service teachers from two programs. Pre-service teachers in the teacher education program had better pedagogical knowledge than those in the general education program. The five sub-scales of the algebra content were significantly correlated with each other. Content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge significantly predicted TPACK. Levels of technology skills among the pre-service teachers had a significant impact on their technology knowledge, technological content knowledge and TPACK. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Information Technology (IT) is changing the face of university classrooms across the country. This change is not simply cosmetic but it affects far more fundamental issues confronting higher education from delivery costs to educational quality to reaching non-traditional students in long distance markets (Massy & Wilger, 1992; Cox, 1998). Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Studio Physics has been one of the forerunners in this new IT based approach to education. The main factors that distinguish Rensselaer's approach are: (a) the main application of IT has been in on-campus undergraduate classrooms, and (b) the main goal of IT applications has been to improve the quality of undergraduate education while maintaining delivery costs. This article presents the results of a cost study of studio physics from 1994 to 1997. The results of this study show that studios physics is currently not cost competitive with traditional, large enrollment lecture courses. This is particularly due to the higher instructional personnel costs of studio physics courses which constitute 74% of the overall course delivery costs compared to 58% in traditional lecture format courses. The study identified possible adjustment measures to reduce studio course delivery costs such as increased enrollments, stream- lined course preparations, and staffing changes. A final analysis of the overall performance of studio courses, however, cannot be made without a more complete analysis of the benefits studio courses offer to both educational institutions and students.

		"abstract": "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and Computer Science (CS) are the driving forces of the United States prosperity. While there is a high demand to close the gap in STEM+CS jobs, there is little research in K-12, especially in K-5 level. Elementary teachers lack of self-confidence in STEM+CS and there is limited number of teacher training. Here, Integrating Computational Thinking (CT) in elementary science classrooms comes into prominence. International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA). and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize that CT learning is an important part of the elementary curriculum. It can be translated that elementary teachers should have the self efficacy, interest, and confidence to integrate CT into their teaching. It is not an easy task to expect such a demand from pre-service elementary science teachers (PST) unless necessary training is provided. It leads us to modify our elementary science teaching methods course to integrate CT to improve PST' CT self-efficacy beliefs, interest, and confidence in elementary teaching. The goal of our research is to investigate the changes in PST' CT teaching efficacy beliefs, interest, and confidence after participating in CT training as part of an undergraduate elementary science teaching methods course. We have found that our course improved PST' CT teaching self-efficacy belief's, interest, and coding confidence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This article reports on an exploratory study of mathematics professors’ proof evaluation practices and the characteristics they value in good proof writing. Four mathematicians were interviewed twice. In the first interview, they evaluated and scored six proofs of elementary theorems written by undergraduate students in a discrete mathematics or geometry course, assigned each proof a score out of 10 points, and responded to questions about the characteristics they value in a well-written proof and how they communicate these characteristics to students. In the second interview, they reevaluated three of the earlier proofs after reading the marks and comments written by the other professors, and evaluated and scored a seventh proof. The results reveal that proof grading is a complex teaching practice requiring difficult judgments about the seriousness of errors and the student’s cognition that led to errors or other flaws. For five of the seven proofs the scores varied by at least 3 points, and the article discusses reasons for this variation. These professors agreed that the most important characteristics of a well-written proof are logical correctness, clarity, fluency, and demonstration of understanding of the proof. Although the professors differed in the attention they gave to fluency issues, such as mathematical notation, layout, grammar, and punctuation, they agreed in giving these characteristics little weight in the overall score.",

		"abstract": "Faculty development workshops are one strategy for increasing instructor use of evidence-based teaching practices that are known to improve student outcomes in mathematics and other STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. Yet relatively little is known about the impact of professional development on teaching practice in higher education. We report findings on participant outcomes from a series of annual, weeklong professional development workshops for college mathematics instructors about Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) in undergraduate mathematics. We gathered data from surveys with the 139 workshop participants and interviews with a subset of 16 participants. These workshops were found to be effective in encouraging instructors to try this student-centered approach to teaching mathematics, as 58 % of participants reported implementing IBL strategies in the year following the workshop they attended. Analysis suggested that certain features of the workshops supported participants’ adoption of IBL strategies. The findings pointed to the importance of (1) sharing broad, inclusive definitions of IBL, (2) representing viewpoints and experiences from diverse institutional contexts, (3) allowing sufficient time within the workshop to explore and revisit topics, (4) addressing common concerns such as content coverage, student resistance, and skills to implement IBL, and (5) providing ongoing follow-up support and inclusion in the community of IBL practitioners. We also make connections with studies of the impact of instructional development in other STEM disciplines and share implications for effective professional development in general.",

		"abstract": "Students’ apprenticeship into proof-oriented mathematical practice requires that they become aware of a range of conventions and assumptions about mathematical language, reference, and inference that rarely appear as explicit components of the content of undergraduate courses. Because these matters of interpretation are often pre-conscious for students and taken for granted by instructors, students may fail to apprehend the problems at hand and thus misunderstand the mathematical community’s solutions. So, we argue that proof-oriented instruction must simultaneously help students understand problems of ambiguity and reference – which requires them to engage in what we call metalinguistic and metamathematical reasoning – as well as provide some informal language for discussing possible solutions to these problems. We provide three illustrative episodes from real analysis classrooms to highlight our common way of framing this class of learning challenge and the pedagogical difficulties they entail. In each case, we highlight the use of analogies as a method of helping students apprehend a problem of mathematical language, reference, or inference and discuss possible solutions. This paper’s contributions are thus both practical and theoretical: the instructional method is intended to serve as one possible approach to training students in mathematical conventions and assumptions, and it helps demonstrate our theoretical perspective on this class of teaching and learning phenomena.",

		"abstract": "In mathematics education research paradoxes of infinity have been used in the investigation of students’ conceptions of infinity. We analyze one such paradox – the Painter’s Paradox – and examine the struggles of a group of Calculus students in an attempt to resolve it. The Painter’s Paradox is based on the fact that Gabriel’s horn has infinite surface area and finite volume and the paradox emerges when finite contextual interpretations of area and volume are attributed to the intangible object of Gabriel’s horn. Mathematically, this paradox is a result of generalized area and volume concepts using integral calculus, as the Gabriel’s horn has a convergent series associated with volume and a divergent series associated with surface area. This study shows that contextual considerations hinder students’ ability to resolve the paradox mathematically. We suggest that the conventional approach to introducing area and volume concepts in Calculus presents a didactical obstacle. A possible alternative is considered.",

The CCR Taxonomy describes the understandings and reasoning abilities assessed by CCR. The CCR is a 25-item multiple-choice instrument that can be used as a placement test for entry into calculus and to assess the effectiveness of precalculus level instruction. Results from administering the CCR to first semester calculus students at the beginning of the semester revealed severe weaknesses in students’ foundational knowledge and reasoning abilities for learning calculus. Correlating CCR results with course grades revealed that students with higher CCR scores are better prepared to succeed in beginning calculus.

The roots of such difficulty, as well as ways to mitigate such difficulty, have not yet been thoroughly studied. In this paper, one particular aspect of students’ counting activity is explored – the use of the problem-solving heuristic of solving smaller, similar problems. Drawing upon student data from clinical interviews in which post-secondary students solved counting problems, four ways in which students successfully utilized this strategy are described. Additionally, three potential pitfalls of the strategy are identified and discussed. Finally, the case is made that the strategy is particularly useful within the area of combinatorics.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, I identify five effective proof reading strategies that mathematics majors can use to comprehend proofs. This paper reports two studies. The first study is a qualitative study in which four successful mathematics majors were videotaped reading six proofs. These students used five proof reading strategies to foster comprehension: (i) trying to prove a theorem before reading its proof, (ii) identifying the proof framework being used in the proof, (iii) breaking the proof into parts or sub-proofs, (iv) illustrating difficult assertions in the proof with an example, and (v) comparing the method used in the proof with one’s own approach. The qualitative analysis of these proof reading strategies illustrates how they may foster comprehension. The second study was a quantitative study in which 83 mathematics professors were surveyed about whether they desired that their students use these strategies. Most mathematicians indicated that they desired that students use them.",

		"abstract": "A rich understanding of key ideas in linear algebra is fundamental to student success in undergraduate mathematics. Many of these fundamental concepts are connected through the notion of equivalence in the Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT). The focus of this paper is the ways in which one student, Abraham, reasoned about solutions to Ax = 0 and Ax = b to draw connections between other concept statements within the IMT. Data sources were video and transcripts from whole class discussion, small group work, and individual interviews. The overarching analytical structure was influenced by a framework of genetic analysis (Saxe, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 11, 275–300, 2002), and Toulmin’s Model of Argumentation (1969) was employed to analyze the structure of arguments both in isolation (microgenesis) and over time (ontogenesis). This case study, rather than focusing on student difficulties in undergraduate mathematics, serves as a compelling example of the productive and powerful reasoning that is possible as students make sense of complex mathematics. The results present an ontogenetic analysis of Abraham’s use of solutions to reason about how span and linear independence of a set of vectors are related, as well microgenetic analyses of various examples of reasoning about solutions to justify connections between other concepts within the IMT.",

In this paper we explore how students perceive generic feedback on a mathematics assignment provided via screencasts. Our study is based on a Differential Equations module taught to first and second year students at a United Kingdom university. Our analysis of a student survey of this novel approach to feedback indicates that some students prefer screencast feedback to written feedback for a number of reasons: it is perceived to be more personal, it provides a richer experience than handwritten comments, it can be accessed anytime and replayed and paused as needed, it assists with learning how to communicate mathematics and it helps develop mathematical thinking skills. In fact, we show that this form of feedback is effective according to Sadler’s (Instructional Science 18:119–144, 1989) definition of effective feedback.",

		"abstract": "In this study, we developed a three-dimensional framework to characterize post-secondary Calculus I final exams. Our Exam Characterization Framework (ECF) classifies individual exam items according to the cognitive demand required to answer the item, the representation of both the task statement and the solution, and the item’s format. Our results from using the ECF to code 150 post-secondary Calculus I final exams from across the United States revealed that the exams generally require low levels of cognitive demand, seldom contain problems stated in a real-world context, rarely elicit explanation, and do not require students to demonstrate or apply their understanding of the course’s central ideas. We compared the results from analyzing individual instructor’s exams with survey data of their beliefs about the conceptual orientation of their exams. Our analysis revealed inconsistencies between our characterization of Calculus I final exams and instructors’ perceptions of their final exams relative to their conceptual focus and the extent to which the exam items ask students to explain their thinking. We also compared the characteristics of our sample of final exams with post-secondary Calculus I final exams administered in 1986/87. We found that Calculus I final exams in U.S. colleges and universities have changed very little in the past 25 years with respect to the percentage of exam items that require students to apply their understanding of foundational concepts, which suggest that the calculus reform movement of the late 1980s has had little effect on what is being assessed in current Calculus I courses in U.S. postsecondary institutions.",

The main findings from our study is that the majority of mathematics majors did not think that graphical perceptual inferences (i.e., inferences based on the appearance of the graph) were permissible in a proof, but the majority of mathematics majors did believe that graphical deductive inferences (i.e., inferences based on what must necessarily be entailed by a graph having a certain property) were permissible.",

		"abstract": "Over the past two decades, the flipped classroom model has gained traction in post-secondary educational settings. However preliminary studies indicate that students perceive a disconnect between out-of-class components and in-class components (Bowers and Zazkis 2012) which may be amplified by the flipped classroom model. The purpose of this paper was to present students’ perceptions of instructional and curricular coherence in a flipped version of a Differential Equations course for 80 undergraduate engineering students. The course was designed to address cognitive obstacles (Herscovics 1989) and to reduce the perceived disconnect between in-class and out-of-class activities. Students’ perceptions of the course suggested that our model for flipped classroom design did circumvent many of the instructional problems reported in prior studies of flipped classrooms.",

		"abstract": "In light of the recent growing interest in conceptual learning and teaching of calculus, and especially with the focus on using technological environments, our study was designed to explore the learning processes and the role played by multiple-linked representations and by interactive technological environment in objectifying the accumulation function. The study focuses on 13 pairs of 17-year-old students familiar with the concept of differentiation but not of integration. The study was inspired and guided by semiotic mediation theory, which considers artefacts to be fundamental to cognition and views learning as a process of becoming aware of the knowledge that exists within a cultural context. Students were asked to explain the possible connection between multiple-linked representations: the function graph, the accumulation function graph, and the table of values of the accumulation function. We include three types of analysis representing the mathematical elements involved in the students’ learning path of the accumulation function, and the students’ interactions with the artefact. The data analysis identified four phases in the processes of objectification. We describe a conceptual structure that typifies the learning of the accumulation function concept in an interactive, multiple-linked representation environment.",

		"abstract": "The importance of improving students’ understanding of core concepts in mathematics is well established. However, assessing the impact of different teaching interventions designed to improve students’ conceptual understanding requires the validation of adequate measures. Here we propose a novel method of measuring conceptual understanding based on comparative judgement (CJ). Contrary to traditional instruments, the CJ approach allows test questions for any topic to be developed rapidly. In addition, CJ does not require a detailed rubric to represent conceptual understanding of a topic, as it is instead based on the collective knowledge of experts. In the current studies, we compared CJ to already established instruments to measure three topics in mathematics: understanding the use of p-values in statistics, understanding derivatives in calculus, and understanding the use of letters in algebra. The results showed that CJ was valid as compared to established instruments, and achieved high reliability. We conclude that CJ is a quick and efficient alternative method of measuring conceptual understanding in mathematics and could therefore be particularly useful in intervention studies.",

We hypothesize that among the difficulties they face in relation with this notion, the graphical evidence provided by the number line fosters the idea of a dichotomy between discreteness and continuity, hiding the property of density-in-itself, i.e. the intrinsic density with respect to order in a totally ordered set. In this paper, we first provide evidences of the weakness of fresh university students’ knowledge about real numbers. Then, we briefly present Dedekind’s construction of real numbers, which relies on the intuitive idea of the continuous line. Finally, we present a didactical situation aimed at fostering the understanding of the relationships between discreteness, density-in-itself and continuity for an ordered set of numbers.",

It is based on a small corpus of research conducted from sociocultural perspectives with qualitative and interpretative studies into mathematics teaching and the meanings it promotes for students learning mathematics. Two settings of teaching are explored: lectures and small group tutorials in which teachers are research mathematicians or mathematics educators. Analyses make use of a range of theoretical perspectives to interpret the complexities of teaching based on observations of teaching activity and interviews with teachers. Critical Theorising is seen through critical use of existing theory and construction of new theory: through the analytical process it provides insights into teaching and ways in which teaching does or can develop to promote students’ meaning making in mathematics. The paper draws attention to the finer details of teaching practice and teachers’ thinking that lie behind judgments such as ‘traditional’ or ‘transmissionist’.",

		"abstract": "Mathematics teachers interact with resources of various kinds in their work in and out of class. The documentational approach of didactics is a theoretical approach that has been elaborated to investigate these interactions and their consequences in terms of teachers’ practice and teachers’ beliefs in particular. According to this approach, using resources teachers develop documents, encompassing these resources and a scheme of use; they also develop structured documents systems and resources systems. I interviewed six university teachers in France and collected the resources they used and designed. Drawing on these data I analyzed their documents and their resources systems, focusing on the features of resources use that appear specific to the university (rather than secondary school) context. I observed that lecturers can develop important agency in the design and use of teaching resources. On the other hand, PhD students starting to teach seem to conform their teaching to ready-made resources; nevertheless, their personal resources and beliefs intervened in their documentation work. Resources and beliefs deriving from the lecturers’ research can also influence the development of documents and thus contribute to shaping the mathematics taught.",

The teachers were in their first year, worked with primarily Hispanic students in rural and urban schools, held undergraduate degrees in science, participated in postbaccalaureate certification programs of varying lengths, and had different cultural backgrounds from the majority of their students. Their beliefs, practices and experiences were documented over the course of a year using the following data sources, semistructured interviews, participant observations, electronic communications, and classroom documents. From the data, individual teacher cases were constructed and then the cases were compared to each other. Conclusions included that the intentions of beginning teachers did not always translate into reality and that enthusiasm for working in diverse environments was not enough for them to enact reform-based practices. The beginning teachers were negotiating a wide range of new experiences, they were just developing their ability to work in these school settings, and they often made their environment less ambiguous by using practices familiar to them. This study suggests that beginning teachers who are working with populations different from their own background require preservice and induction programs that support crucial practices and that those who hire beginning teachers need to take initial teaching assignments into careful consideration.",

Unfortunately, such lore is often restricted to the discussion of these phenomena in the context of great mathematicians and great mathematical advancement. But are such experiences reserved only for the upper echelons of mathematical practice? This study focuses on the impact of these AHA! experiences on undergraduate mathematics students' affective domain. In particular, the role of the positive emotion that accompanies such moments of illumination in changing the attitudes and beliefs of 'resistant' students is examined. That is, pre-service elementary school teachers who deem themselves to be incapable and/or phobic of mathematics and the learning of mathematics but are forced to take an undergraduate mathematics course as qualification for entry into a teacher education programme. The results indicate that an AHA! experience has a transformative effect on 'resistant' students' affective domains, creating positive beliefs and attitudes about mathematics as well as their abilities to do mathematics.",

		"abstract": "In the past decade, there has been an increased emphasis on the preparation of teachers who can effectively engage students in meaningful mathematics with technology tools. This study presents a closer look at how three prospective teachers interpreted and developed in their role of facilitating students' mathematical problem solving with a technology tool. A cycle of planning-experience-reflection was repeated twice during an undergraduate course to allow the prospective teachers to change their strategies when working with two different groups of students. Case study methods were used to identify and analyze critical events that occurred throughout the different phases of the study and how these events may have influenced the prospective teachers' work with students. Looking across the cases, several themes emerged. The prospective teachers (1) used their problem solving approaches to influence their pedagogical decisions; (2) desired to ask questions that would guide students in their solution strategies; (3) recognized their own struggle in facilitating students' problem solving and focused on improving their interactions with students; (4) assumed the role of an explainer for some portion of their work with students; (5) used technological representations to promote students' mathematical thinking or focus their attention; and (6) used the technology tools in ways consistent with the nature of their interactions and perceived role with students. The implications inform the development of an expanded learning trajectory for what we might expect as prospective teachers develop an understanding of how to teach mathematics in technology-rich environments. © Springer 2005.",

		"abstract": "Of 19 college algebra classes, 12 used WeBWorK and 7 used traditional paper and pencil homework (PPH). Given the earlier quantitative result that no significant difference in performance between WeBWorK and PPH classes was found, a qualitative analysis of 358 student and instructor surveys revealed 3 primary categories of student perceptions related to WeBWorK: views about its usefulness, intentionality in engaging with mathematics, and challenges to student beliefs about mathematics. Student and instructor comments are reported within the context of self-regulated learning. Results support the conjecture that even a narrow use of WeBWorK, as a substitute for handwritten homework, is at least as effective as traditionally graded paper and pencil homework for students learning college algebra.

		"abstract": "Understanding abstract concepts and ideas in mathematics, if instruction takes place in the first language of the student, is difficult. Yet worldwide students often have to master mathematics via a second or third language. The majority of students in South Africa - a country with eleven official languages - has to face this difficulty. In a quantitative study of first year calculus students, we investigated two groups of students, For one group tuition took place in their home language; for the second group, tuition was in English, a second or even a third language. Performance data on their secondary mathematics and first year tertiary calculus were analysed. The study showed that there was no significant difference between the adjusted means of the entire group of first language learners and the entire group of second language learners. Neither was there any statistically significant difference between the performances of the two groups of second language learners (based on the adjusted means). Yet, there did seem to be a significant difference between the achievement of Afrikaans students attending Afrikaans lectures and Afrikaans students attending English lectures.

		"abstract": "This paper develops early data from a qualitative longitudinal study of the first cohort of five students making the transition from teaching assistant in secondary school to specialist teacher of secondary mathematics. Data from a second cohort of four women and one man starting in 2003 is less complete, but used as appropriate. Bernstein’s work on subject classification frames an argument that this student group navigates simultaneously two mathematics discourses: ‘hard’ university mathematics, and ‘everyday mathematics’ as experienced by the lower ability school pupils that the students support. This raises questions about thepurpose and scope of the students ’ work in school with respect to their mathematics learning, and vice versa. Macrae, Brown, and Rodd’s (2003)study of conventional mathematics undergraduates provides a foil against which to compare approaches to learning mathematics, raising the possibility of a rethink of pre-requisite pre-qualification, andpotential relations between university mathematics and work-place learning in secondary schools. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

		"abstract": "An appropriate understanding of the nature of the scientific enterprise (NOSE) is a key element of scientific literacy and can arguably be influenced through an exploration of the history of science. An elective, undergraduate History of Science course was organized in the form of small-group discussion-based inquiries into the history of science from ancient to modern times. Group discussions focused on STATEMENTS OF CRITICAL SIGNIFICANCE (SOCS) prepared by individual students on assigned readings prior to each class meeting. Small-group discussions were followed by a synthesis, facilitated by the instructor, of points raised in SOCS and other ideas central to the reading. The overarching goal of these activities was to help students see the multifaceted nature of the scientific enterprise in the context of social, political, cultural, and religious milieu of the time period and the geographic setting within which specific scientific activities and developments took place. The impact of this course on student understanding of the NOSE was assessed through the use of VIEWS ON SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY-SOCIETY (VOSTS) instrument administered as pre- and post-test. Qualitative data regarding student understanding of the NOSE were furnished by the final exam on the NOSE written in the form of SOCS at the end of semester. Results based on four semesters of the course offering indicate modest gains in student understanding of specific aspects of the NOSE. They are discussed, along with the usefulness of small-group, discussion-based inquiries into the history of science as a way of enhancing scientific literacy during undergraduate science education. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2005.",

		"abstract": "There is evidence worldwide that governments seek to effect a change in the culture of tertiary institutions with increasing emphasis placed on the quality of education at the tertiary level. As a consequence, there is a need to understand the learning experiences of undergraduate students. Here we report on an investigation of first‐year learning experiences in two first‐year chemistry one‐semester courses in a New Zealand tertiary educational institution. We sought to identify positive and negative learning experiences at the first‐year undergraduate level for chemistry students. Students were surveyed using the learning experiences scale of the Chemistry Attitudes and Experiences Questionnaire (CAEQ) twice in the academic year (end of the first semester N = 109; end of the second semester N = 84). In addition, 17 students enrolled in a first‐year chemistry course were interviewed at the beginning of their tertiary education career and again at the end of their first and second‐semester chemistry courses. The research findings suggest that students dislike a lecturing style that includes providing them with a complete set of notes before the lecture. They enjoy tutorials, but surprisingly are less positive about their practical learning experiences due, in part, to the emphasis on volumetric analysis. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The crisis in UK mathematics education, both in schools and universities, has been widely reported. Currently, 24% of full-time mathematics teachers in English secondary education have `weak’ or `nil’ qualifications in the subject, 31% of secondary mathematics teachers are now over the age of 50, and it is estimated that England alone is short of 3500 qualified mathematics teachers. Furthermore, studies suggest that UK mathematics undergraduates often lack confidence in several key skills essential for teaching, and the availability of attractive careers for mathematics graduates impacts upon the numbers entering the profession, thus risking a spiral of decline. This paper recounts the development of a unit of study in the Faculty of Mathematical Studies at the University of Southampton, England, in conjunction with a new national initiative entitled the Undergraduate Ambassadors Scheme (UAS). This aims to address the crisis in UK mathematics education through the training and placement of final year undergraduates as teaching assistants in local schools, with a view to promoting mathematics as a university choice to the broadest possible constituency, whilst simultaneously developing those key skills in which undergraduates regularly feel least confident, and facilitating an insight into teaching as a career option. The paper also provides a detailed evaluation of this new initiative, together with the recent comments of students who, having completed the UAS unit, have progressed subsequently to postgraduate teacher education.

In discussing the background to, and context of, the curriculum development at the centre of this case study, we highlight the current importance of such innovation to policy makers who are seeking to develop this area of the mathematics qualifications framework. Our findings suggest that these new qualifications, as implemented in this particular case, can effect the changes that were originally desired. However, we conclude that there is a need for further substantial research that builds on this study if proposed changes to post-14 qualifications in mathematics are to be informed by knowledge of how such innovation may be successfully implemented more widely. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Participating instructors attended summer institutes that modeled reform-based practices and fostered reflection on current issues in science, mathematics, and technological literacy for K-16 teaching, with an explicit emphasis on the importance of creating the best possible learning experience for prospective K-12 science and mathematics teachers. Utilizing a unique classroom observation protocol (the Oregon-Teacher Observation Protocol) and interviews, the authors (a) conclude that some reform-oriented teaching strategies are evident in undergraduate mathematics and science instruction and (b) suggest areas in which additional support and feedback are needed in order for higher education faculty members to adopt reform-based instructional methodology.",

		"abstract": "Literature suggests that the type of context wherein a task is placed relates to students' performance and solution strategies. In the particular domain of logical thinking, there is the belief that students have less difficulty reasoning in verbal than in logically equivalent symbolic tasks. Thus far, this belief has remained relatively unexplored in the domain of teaching and learning of mathematics, and has not been examined with respect to students' major field of study. In this study, we examined the performance of 95 senior undergraduate mathematics and education majors in symbolic and verbal tasks about the contraposition equivalence rule. The selection of two different groups of participants allowed for the examination of the hypothesis that students' major may influence the relation between their performance in tasks about contraposition and the context (symbolic/verbal) wherein this is placed. The selection of contraposition equivalence rule also addressed a gap in the body of research on undergraduate students' understanding of proof by contraposition. The analysis was based on written responses of all participants to specially developed tasks and on semi-structured interviews with 11 subjects. The findings showed different variations in the performance of each of the two groups in the two contexts. While education majors performed significantly better in the verbal than in the symbolic tasks, mathematics majors' performance showed only modest variations. The results call for both major- and context- specific considerations of students' understanding of logical principles, and reveal the complexity of the system of factors that influence students' logical thinking.

		"abstract": "Current e-learning environments are ill-suited to college mathematics. Instructors/students struggle to post diagrams and math notation. A new generation of math-friendly e-learning tools, including WebEQ, bundled with Blackboard 6, and NetTutor's Whiteboard, address these problems. This paper compares these two systems using criteria for ideal math-friendly e-learning systems. NetTutor's Whiteboard is, apparently, the only system allowing two-way communication of both diagrams and math notation between instructor and students. This paper also summarizes a case study of two community college mathematics courses (calculus and algebra) using NetTutor over two semesters. Pilot studies, interviews and experimental problems revealed that NetTutor's Whiteboard is effective for 2-way communication of diagrams and math notation in college courses. Learning difficult concepts was comparable to face-to-face courses. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The current emphasis on flexible modes of mathematics delivery involving new information and communication technology (ICT) at the university level is perhaps a reaction to the recent change in the objectives of education. Abstract algebra seems to be one area of mathematics virtually crying out for computer instructional support because of the availability of multi-representational tools and appropriate software that can be used to bridge the existing gap between the concrete and the abstract. This paper focuses on the use of the computer program, Excel, in teaching an introductory group theory course at the university level. Here the author describes the use of the Excel ‘fill-handle’ and ability to colour blocks of cells as cosets quickly in constructing and completing Cayley tables for abstract groups. The relation of the approach to constructivist philosophies and cooperative learning is discussed. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Data on each student teacher were gathered via field notes of three classes, an observation protocol completed after each lesson, and an interview. Composites were written for each of the students. The total data set of all composites was examined to see if any patterns generalizable to the whole were evident.

		"abstract": "The present research study investigates how undergraduate students in an integrated calculus and physics class use physics to help them solve calculus problems. Using Zandieh's (2000) framework for analyzing student understanding of derivative as a starting point, this study adds detail to her \"paradigmatic physical\" context and begins to address the need for a theoretical basis for investigating learning and teaching in integrated mathematics and science classrooms. A case study design was used to investigate the different ways students use physics ideas as they worked through calculus tasks. Data were gathered through four individual interviews with each of 8 ICP students, classroom participant-observation, and triangulation of the data through student homework and exams. The main result of this study is the Physics Use Classification Scheme, a tool consisting of four categories used to characterize students' uses of physics on tasks involving average rate of change, derivative, and integral concepts. Two of the categories from the Physics Use Classification Scheme are elucidated with contrasting student cases in this paper.",

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over the course of 3 weeks of instruction. We examined the influence of the software on: group interactions; the mathematical investigations of learners; and the teacher’s interactions with students. Data points to four distinct ways in which the presence of NuCalc positively impacted the learning community we studied: (1) it served as a tool for extending students’ mathematical thinking, (2) it motivated students’ engagement in group discourse, (3) it became a tool for mediating discourse, (4) it became a catalyst for refining the culture of classroom, shifting the patterns of interactions between the teacher and learners.

Based upon research conducted in an undergraduate teacher preparation program, this case study describes how the author used teacher portfolios to mentor prospective teachers in new ways. The case describes the author's experiences through a case study of his assessment of and response to one prospective teacher's portfolio. This portfolio illustrated themes that were present in other teachers' portfolios, but did so in ways that highlighted strategies for change to the methods course. Through the lens of this teacher's portfolio the author identified specific ways that the prospective teacher's beliefs were impacting her teaching practice, a result that enabled him to better help all of the teachers in the methods course reflect on their teaching. By providing a detailed account of the feedback process that led to this result, this paper illustrates how mathematics teacher educators can use prospective teachers' portfolios to enrich the quality of their methods courses.",

It presents a practical application of an educational experiment and initial results based on comparative instruction of two samples of students (n = 56). The application concept should improve the efficiency of the teacher's activity and professional education at the tertiary level. It could be used in disciplines having a strong logical structure and formalization. The concept is aimed at higher educational objectives such as understanding, application, analysis and synthesis. The students are presented with practical examples from their professional life—algorithmization, compilers etc. This educational method is especially recommended for teachers (in-service education) and practically oriented professionals (distance education).

		"abstract": "Scenarios in which a teacher provides the student with an initial description or demonstration of some procedure to be learned are common in many science and technology fields. Structuring such initial presentations to assist rather than inhibit the student's representation of the target procedure is a real pedagogical concern. Production systems approaches to depicting procedural learning were used to derive four implications for such structuring. These implications were tested in two studies, one in a real class context of undergraduate mathematics study. Corroborating earlier research, clear learning advantages were found for embedding a procedure's steps in an explicit hierarchical goal structure. Extending earlier research, learning advantages were also found for distinguishing and making explicit both the actions and the signalling conditions that comprise those steps. The development of teaching proficiency in the specific skill of initially describing or demonstrating procedures is considered. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Two to three decades ago this course became a requirement for math and computer science students in most universities world wide. Today this course is taken by students in many other disciplines as well. The paper begins with a discussion of a few topics that we feel should be included in the syllabus for any course in Discrete Mathematics, independent of the audience. We then discuss several potential models for teaching the course, depending upon the interests and mathematical background of the audience. We also investigate various educational links with other components of the curriculum, consider pedagogical issues associated with the teaching of discrete mathematics, and discuss some logistical and psychological difficulties that must be overcome.

		"abstract": "The crisis in UK mathematics education, both in schools and universities, has been widely reported in the national media. A recent study shows that 26% of full-time mathematics teachers in UK schools have no qualification in the subject, and that 31% of all UK schools' mathematics teachers are now over the age of 50. The crisis in school mathematics has impacted on much of the university sector, with some departments under threat of closure and widespread difficulties experienced in student recruitment. The availability of attractive careers for mathematics graduates impacts upon the numbers choosing to enter teaching, thus risking a spiral of decline. Furthermore, studies suggest that UK mathematics graduates often lack confidence in several key skills essential for teaching, such as presenting information effectively, working in teams, and written communication. This paper recounts the development of a unit of study in the Faculty of Mathematical Studies at the University of Southampton, England, in conjunction with a new initiative, the Undergraduate Ambassadors Scheme, which seek to address the crisis in UK mathematics education through the training and placement of final year undergraduates as teaching assistants in local schools. This with a view to promoting mathematics to the broadest possible constituency as a university choice, whilst simultaneously developing those key transferable skills in which undergraduates regularly feel least confident, and allowing undergraduates to experience a flavour of teaching as a career option.

		"abstract": "This study investigated differences and shifts in learning and motivation constructs among male and female students in a nonmajors, yearlong structured inquiry college physics course and examined how these variables were related to physics understanding and course achievement. Tests and questionnaires measured students' learning approaches, motivational goals, self-efficacy, epistemological beliefs, scientific reasoning abilities, and understanding of central physics concepts at the beginning and end of the course. Course achievement scores were also obtained. The findings showed that male students had significantly higher self-efficacy, performance goals, and physics understanding compared to females, which persisted throughout the course. Differential shifts were found in students' meaningful learning approaches, with females tending to use less meaningful learning from beginning to end of the course; and males using more meaningful learning over this time period. For both males and females, self-efficacy significantly predicted physics understanding and course achievement. For females, higher reasoning ability was also a significant predictor of understanding and achievement; whereas for males, learning goals and rote learning were significant predictors, but in a negative direction. The findings reveal that different variables of learning and motivation may be important for females' success in inquiry physics compared to males. Instructors should be cognizant of those needs in order to best help all students learn and achieve in college physics.",

Problem solving knowledge and skills are not an explicit objective of teaching and their development depends largely on the student's private mathematical activity.

Case teaching is an incredibly adaptable instructional method able to involve students in higher levels of cognitive processing. The explicit purposes of this article are (a) to answer some of the basic questions about case teaching and (b) to show how other science and engineering professors have employed cases in their college courses. The basic questions addressed in the article include the following: What is case teaching? What can case teaching do for college science classrooms? and Where can I go to get more information on case teaching? Information from the National Center for Case Teaching in Science website is referenced. The second half of this article illustrates how cases are used in college science and engineering courses based upon interviews with expert case teachers. Several descriptive vignettes and \"lessons\" from these experts are available to show how case teaching can be applied in diverse contexts.",

		"abstract": "A common maxim in the educational profession is that one teaches the way one is taught. Indications are that preservice teachers' beliefs, attitudes, and practices may be linked to previous experiences. Calderhead & Robson (1991) underscored this concern by asserting that teachers use good teachers as models for developing their own images as teachers. Others have argued that the images held by teachers are used as frames of reference for their own teaching practices. In this article, preservice teachers' perceptions of themselves as science teachers are examined. The assertion is made that a long history of stereotypical science learning experiences--in elementary school, high school, and college--powerfully impacts the way in which elementary preservice teachers understand the nature of science and come to believe science should be taught. In the current study, the images and perceptions preservice teachers bring to science methods courses (as evidenced in drawings of themselves as science teachers at work) are identified and ways these images and perceptions may have been formed and how they can be reinforced or modified during a science methods course are discussed.",

One intent of this study was to examine the development of such students’ PUPAs and possibly to identify significant influences onthat development, through interviews with the students throughout their studies in mathematics. Three case studies show a great variance in the development of the students’ proof skills. Some students come to university with excellent PUPAs and continue to thrive in a proof environment. Others enter university with poor PUPAs and unfortunately graduate without a significant change in their proof skills and attitudes. Still others come with poor proof skills but do showsome growth during their undergraduate mathematics programs. Results of teaching experiments suggest that making proofs tangible is a means of helping those with poor PUPAs to grow in their proof understandings and abilities. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This article reports on an exploratory study of the way that eight mathematics and secondary education mathematics majors read and reflected on four student-generated arguments purported to be proofs of a single theorem. The results suggest that such undergraduates tend to focus on surface features of arguments and that their ability to determine whether arguments are proofs is very limited-perhaps more so than either they or their instructors recognize. The article begins by discussing arguments (purported proofs) regarded as texts and validations of those arguments, that is, reflections of individuals checking whether such arguments really are proofs of theorems. It relates the mathematics research community's views of proofs and their validations to ideas from reading comprehension and literary theory. Then, a detailed analysis of the four student-generated arguments is given and the eight students' validations of them are analyzed.",

Specifically, it examined the impact of science methods courses, student teaching, and science content courses on elementary preservice teachers' science teaching self-efficacy. The Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument Form B was administered, using a pre/post design, to undergraduate elementary education majors in specific education and science content courses. A total of 399 responses were collected, of which 172 had matching pre/post surveys suitable for analysis. Students in the science content courses and student teaching seminar showed no significant change in either the Personal Science Teaching Efficacy (PSTE) or the Science Teaching Outcome Expectancy scales during the time they were enrolled in the classes. Significant gains in PSTE were found for students enrolled in the science methods course. The specific design of the education program and methods course may be responsible for these changes.",

Respondents were 459 first year mathematics students from four universities and one teacher college. Results indicated that more than half the sample reported mathematics to be a subject made of numbers and formulae that could be memorized. This suggests a shallow emphasis when learning the subject, with no intention to understand. However, most students passed their examinations. It was concluded that there was no statistically significant relationship between examinations results and students' learning orientations. It is recommended that lecturers should foster students' meta-learning capabilities and an awareness of different learning strategies. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This case study was an investigation of the role of the institutional culture of a university in the process of changing to reform-based practices for two college mathematics professors. A framework is presented for identifying and analyzing institutional norms and policies that are present and those lacking in supporting faculty efforts toward reform. The primary categories considered in the framework are the teaching and learning context, the professional community, and the university's reward system. This framework is applied to the cases, and findings indicate that institutional norms in the forms of priorities for how time is allocated to professional responsibilities (as part of the teaching context), and colleagues and administrators who understood and shared the professors' goals for reform (as part of the professional community) strongly influenced the professors' efforts toward change. Additionally, a reward system that recognized efforts to improve teaching and learning was critical in establishing a culture that promoted change. However, despite the fact that both professors were in the same mathematics department, the nature of the influence of these factors was not uniform. The institutional culture indeed had multiple layers that required examination for each professor's individual context. The findings help highlight the importance of institutional context for both K-12 and college level teaching and learning. The nature of these influential factors and the institutional layers were discussed for each case, along with implications for other institutions.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates the way collaborative learning that occurs primarily outside the classroom affects college students' understanding of science. Collaborative learning is particularly important for the increasing number of nontraditional students who have limited time available for study groups and other peer learning activities occurring outside of class time. Using a national study of 4,644 college students of various academic majors, multiple linear regression was used to identify variables that enhance science learning. Time spent in peer learning settings, such as teaching science to peers and discussing science with peers, were the strongest predictors of understanding science; moreover, this finding was consistent even for nontraditional students who reported less frequency of engagement in such activities. The study suggests that science educators can enhance learning when they structure their courses to include peer learning that engages students with each other over science issues outside the classroom.",

Written response data were collected from 173 student teachers (trainees) from several different institutions and their views were collated and thematised. The principal issues that arise are those of discontinuity of experience from school to university, the lack of preparedness for ``struggle'' in the face of challenging mathematics at university and an unresponsive style of teaching and assessing. The significance of these views to the students as prospective teachers and the ways in which they could be used by teacher educators on training courses is discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Research to date has tended to concentrate on students' knowledge and understanding prior to university entrance or in the first year of undergraduate mathematics courses. The design of this research, similar in style to a viva voce, involved probing students' conceptual understanding of convergence and continuity and associated reasoning.

Vergnaud's theory of conceptual fields is used and refined to analyze students’ attempts to test membership of given numbers and to generate elements that are members of a given infinite arithmetic sequence. Our results indicate that participants made a strong distinction between two types of arithmetic sequences: sequences of multiples (e.g., 7, 14, 21, 28,…) and sequences of ‘non‐multiples,’ (e.g., 8, 15, 22, 29,…). Students were more successful in recognizing the underlying structure of elements in sequences of multiples, whereas for sequences of non‐multiples students often preferred algebraic computations and were mostly unaware of the invariant structure linking the two types. We examine the development of students’ schemes as they identify differences and similarities in the situations presented to them. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The purpose of the article is to present an analysis of the classroom mathematical practices that were established over the first half of the semester including instruction on first order differential equations. We discuss and illustrate our use of Toulmin’s model of argumentation to develop an analytical technique for documenting the emergence and stability of classroom mathematical practices. This analysis is significant in that it contributes to an emerging body of research on students’ learning in social context, in particular at the undergraduate level where such analyses are lacking. Our analysis also serves as a case to examine the construct of classroom mathematical practices in new light and to extend prior research by documenting two theoretical ideas; that practices can emerge in a non-sequential fashion with regard to both time and structure.

		"abstract": "Time delays are an important aspect of mathematical modelling, but often result in highly complicated equations which are difficult to treat analytically. In this paper it is shown how careful application of certain undergraduate tools such as the Method of Steps and the Principle of the Argument can yield significant results. Certain delay differential equations arising in population dynamics may serve as good teaching examples for these methods. The determination of linear stability properties for an ordinary differential equation with a varying time delay is carried out through discrete point analysis, either by seeking explicit solutions or leading to the consideration of a difference equation and the roots of a characteristic polynomial. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB Simulink are compared to the analytical solutions, and computation is also used to suggest extensions to some results. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This article presents teaching ideas designed to support the belief that students at all levels (preservice teachers, majors, secondary and elementary students) need exposure to non-routine problems that illustrate the effective use of technology in their resolution. Such use provides students with rapid and accurate data collection, leading them to sound conjectures, which is a precursor to learning mathematical proof. Students will therefore learn that while technology can be an effective tool for investigating problems, the onus of providing convincing arguments and proofs of their conjectures rests squarely on their shoulders. The paper describes how a diverse group of students took advantage of the power of the TI-92 to enhance their chances of reaching this final stage of proof. A series of mathematical problems are presented and analysed with a keen eye on the appropriate integration of the TI-92. A student survey was used to inform the results. To conclude, several challenging, yet accessible, non-routine problems were completed by students as undergraduate research projects, all using the TI-92 as a laboratory. Although most of the problems presented here have a discrete mathematics flavour, the authors' message is independent of the mathematical topic chosen. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This investigation uses classroom discourse in an undergraduate mathematics course to challenge pre-service secondary mathematics teachers' notions about mathematical discourse, what it might resemble in the classroom, and how its various forms can be cultivated by classroom teachers. The research setting was a required geometry course taught by the author. Eleven pre-service mathematics teachers in their junior or senior year of an undergraduate program participated. Results indicated participants made a transition toward an image of discourse as an active process by which students use the collective knowledge of their peers to build mathematical understanding and developed in their ability to participate in such discourse. This awareness, along with participants' analyses of their own habits of discourse as classroom teachers, prompted shifts in their projected image of the role of discourse in their future practices of teaching. Results suggested further that the undergraduate mathematics classroom (as opposed to the methods classroom) offers a powerful and unique forum in which pre-service secondary teachers can practice, articulate, and collectively reflect on reform-minded ways of teaching.

		"abstract": "The paper describes an inquiry into students' uses of graphics calculators in the Tertiary Entrance Examination of Calculus in Western Australia for 1998, which was the first year that calculators were allowed for the examination. The prevalence of calculator usage and marks allocated for six questions are considered, based on data collected from examination markers. The nature of calculator usage is described, including errors made, based on our perusal of examination scripts and interviews with students, teachers and markers. A comparative analysis of boys' and girls' performance, as measured by raw examination scores on the examination for 1995-1998 is given. The results suggest that the main areas of difficulty for students are interpreting graphics calculator outputs and knowing when use of graphics calculators is appropriate or possible. While initial indications are that the effect of introducing the calculators is non-discriminatory between boys and girls, no claims can be made without longer-term analysis. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The aim of the study reported on in this paper was to develop, test and improve a cognitive tool which could help students structure their mathematical knowledge and skills. Mathematics teaching as an auxiliary subject in the context of secondary or tertiary education courses in other disciplines pays too little attention to the structure of the mathematical concepts presented. For the students, therefore, the network of relationships between these concepts does not become a part of their mathematical knowledge and skills, and is consequently not fully available for purposes of reasoning, proving, mathematicizing and solving problems. Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be used by students as a tool to visualize this structure of the concepts and the relations between them. The learning activity of structuring one's mathematical knowledge and skills can be supported by a model, the Mathematical Knowledge Graph Model (MKGM), which serves as a pre-structured heuristic framework. The elements of this model include a central concept, special cases of this concept, operations or actions on the concept, areas of application and properties of the concepts and operations. The present paper reports on a trial among five students of the Open University of the Netherlands (OUNL), who constructed a KG in accordance with the MKGM model. The paper focuses on the graphs produced by the students, their appreciation of the structuring activity and the relation between their graphs and test results. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Using data from a classroom teaching experiment in differential equations as an example, we document the social and sociomathematical norms regarding explanation and discuss how these norms were constituted in this specific case. We focus on the social norms that students explain their thinking and try to make sense of other students' thinking and, for first-order differential equations, we document the sociomathematical norm that explanations be grounded in an interpretation of the rates of change. The analysis makes explicit certain social aspects of classroom environments that contribute to the conditions that make meaningful learning of mathematics possible. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",

		"abstract": "This study investigated, from the students', professor's, and researchers' perspectives, the effects of a reform-based introductory undergraduate mathematics course, and the efforts of a mathematics professor to teach such a course. The class had been designed for teacher candidates of middle school mathematics and science (Grades 4 to 8) but was open to all qualified students. We addressed the following research question: What perceptions about learning and teaching mathematics emerged through the participants' experiences in a reform-based mathematics course? Results of the analysis of the data suggested that the teacher candidates and the professor took an important first step toward enculturation into a reform-based vision of mathematics learning and teaching. Implications for mathematics faculty and teacher education faculty interested in promoting reform-based mathematics are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The paper describes the changes that are being made in the mathematics teachers' subject studies in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Joensuu, in order to provide our mathematics students both with a sufficiently deep knowledge of mathematics and science, and with present-day expertise in their profession as teachers. While the formal structure of the mathematics curriculum remains structured and taught as courses with mostly traditional names like algebra, analysis, and linear algebra, there are also totally new ‘professionally oriented’ courses. Some of the old courses—with rather traditional and rigorous contents—have been changed in a more student-driven direction. In these ‘pedagogically oriented’ courses students are encouraged, and even forced, to study co-operatively in social interaction, for example to negotiate how to solve a problem decently, or how to build a formal definition for a concept with certain wanted attributes. As an ultimate example of a pedagogical experiment we describe in more detail an abstract algebra course, where co-operative learning is combined with intensive programming in a mathematically oriented computer environment. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "As part of an investigation of the mathematical and pedagogical development of prospective teachers, the second author taught mathematics to a group of undergraduate teacher candidates in a way that is compatible with current mathematics education reform principles. Initially, the lack of a shared basis for communication was evident when these students, acculturated to the practices of school mathematics, interacted with a teacher who was trying to promote inquiry mathematics. Our analysis of the data indicates that by the latter stages of the course, a classroom microculture characterized by inquiry mathematics had evolved. In this article, we examine the processes by which the participants in this classroom community negotiated norms and practices. The result of this analysis was an identification and elaboration of four categories of interaction central to the ongoing negotiation. This article illustrates how each of these categories of interaction contributed to the negotiation of new norms and practices. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",

		"abstract": "Based on 30 syllabi and 108 questionnaire responses from randomly selected U.S. colleges and universities, college geometry courses were analyzed with respect to content, pedagogy, and assessment. About 40% of the courses start with elementary axioms and emphasize Euclidean geometry or a mix of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry; 23% employ a survey approach; and 20% employ an analytic or projective geometry approach. In about 63% of the courses, the instructor lectures most or all of the time; in 36% of the courses a substantial amount of class time is devoted to group work; and about 27% of the courses reflect nearly all the characteristics of good mathematics teaching as defined by the NCTM Professional Teaching Standards. In most courses, in-class examinations, homework, and a final examination are the primary evaluation tools; in about half of the courses at least one alternative assessment contributes to the final grade. Common characteristics are evident but wide diversity exists also. A typical geometry course did not emerge from the data. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The construction of a test instrument is discussed relating its purpose to the concerns of the preparation of students voiced by such as Anderson et al., to underlying theories of learning, Slavit, and to other taxonomies, Smith et al. The results of applying the questionnaire to 423 students in the period 1994–1996 is analysed and evaluated, focusing on the distributions of the distractors chosen by the students. Results suggest that the instrument is robust, that the taxonomy used is effective and raises questions that affect the teaching and learning paradigms used for mathematics pre-university and on entry to university. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Previous research suggests that a range of factors can influence students' academic decisions. The focus of the paper is on one of these potential sources of influence— students' perceptions of the tertiary mathematics learning environment. Data from two large-scale surveys (N = 1883) and from a smaller number of interviews (N = 71) with students enrolled in tertiary mathematics courses at five Australian universities are presented and discussed. Collectively, the survey results and the interview data reveal considerable variations in the quality of the teaching and student support available in different mathematics departments. Students' comments were constructive and offered valuable ideas for improving the existing situation, retaining current students and attracting others to mathematics. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "In a study involving three sections of 181 pre-calculus students at a four-year college, partial credit scoring on multiple-choice questions was examined over an entire semester. Questions were constructed by experienced teachers to pose carefully designed, incorrect alternatives, many of which implicitly suggested varying degrees of partial knowledge or understanding. Computing students' course grades based solely on percentage correct scoring resulted in a course-wide GPA of 1.38. This seemed inconsistent with the fact that students were screened for entry into the course. To avert apparent grade deflation due to such right/wrong scoring, student scores were recomputed based on supplementing percentage correct scores with partial credit. This resulted in a course-wide increase in GPA to 1.92. Using that same letter grade distribution, and curving percentage correct averages to achieve the 1.92 GPA, it was found that 10% of the students were given different grades from those determined by the partial credit scoring. Regarding the efficacy of awarding partial credit points, it was found that partial credit by itself measured achievement of relevant mathematical skills that were missed by percentage correct scoring. Overall, grades determined by partial credit scoring seemed more reflective of both the quantity and quality of student knowledge than grades determined by either traditional percentage correct scoring or any corrective curving. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Studies have shown that not only middle and high school students have difficulties with inequalities, but those of college age as well, particularly in the following four areas: (a) regarding inequalities as equations; (b) a limited understanding of the terms \"more\" and \"less\" and of the corresponding relational symbols; (c) difficulties relating and using different solving techniques; and (d) interpreting solutions. To be able to accurately understand and correct misconceptions about inequalities held by students, teachers must know how to represent inequalities in various ways. Tsamir and Bazzini (2004) suggest that teachers be constantly aware of the misconceptions students have and promote student awareness of their misconceptions.",

		"abstract": "Some of the problems of teaching mathematics and statistics to non-specialist mathematics students are highlighted when teaching social sciences undergraduates. The mathematical attainment, ability and needs of these students are particularly diverse. Traditional teaching methods are inappropriate because of the students’ personal characteristics and because of the teaching situation of the rest of their course. Content is also a problem. Mathematics has developed together with the natural sciences and the needs of priorities of the social sciences are different. These problems are seen not merely as a necessary evil, but it is suggested that in solving them, social scientists may be able to see more clearly the role of mathematics in the social sciences, and gain a new perspective of the relationships among the social sciences. © 1971 by John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",

This leads to a discussion of the contribution which can be made to the development of these components by ‘discovery methods’, and of how these may be used in undergraduate teaching.

It is felt that the use of the conversational mode may emphasize some of the points of educational interest which arise in the elementary FORTRAN IV programs which are used to generate the array of coefficients. Two methods are adopted: The first involving a direct calculation using binomial coefficients and the second utilizing a recurrence relation.

Among the topics discussed are: The aims of the course; the problem of students’ varying mathematical backgrounds and abilities, and in particular the very low level of mathematics of a significant number of them; the question of a common course for all social sciences, and the differing needs of the various subjects; who should teach introductory statistics; the problem of developing students’ motivation to study statistics; the use of practical work; the possibilities of the computer; the utility of programmed texts and teaching machines.

There were, however, inevitable implications for teaching and he drew attention to certain specific recommendations about this. The first recommendation had been that meetings of university teachers should be arranged and this present seminar was an example of what he had had in mind. In addition he had recommended that the activities of the Educational Study Group of the Royal Statistical Society deserved support. Since the appearance of the Report this group had, with the encouragement of the Society, become the independently constituted Committee on Statistical Education and was mounting projects to develop materials to aid the teaching of statistics at pre-university levels. In this field the Joint Committee of the R.S.S. and the Institute of Statisticians were also devoting some attention to the problems of technical colleges and polytechnics. © 1973 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

At the beginning of term, 128 first year students completed a pre-test in basic mathematical concepts and at the end of term, 112 of this total completed a similar post-test. Of these, 48 students, most of whom had O level mathematical backgrounds, followed the elementary mathematics course. Methods used with different groups of these students included selfinstructional learning programmes written especially for the course, a lecture course together with classes involving the use of a desk computer and a straight lecture course. Although the resulting statistics showed no clear differences in effectiveness between teaching methods used, this may be attributed to problems of control and design of experiment. The results together with student attitudes, however, provide valuable indications of how students' needs in this area may be more adequately met. © 1973 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Control Technology is a particular field of engineering in which mathematical concepts play an extremely large part. Undergraduate control courses include the relation of mathematical models to practical situations. This is supported by laboratory work in which practical tests are carried out on systems and the results of these tests compared with what may be predicted by the theory taught in lectures. In order that the students' time is used effectively it is desirable that the practical and theoretically predicted results may be readily compared and that this comparison is not lost in a welter of tedious arithmetic of sometimes doubtful accuracy. By integrating a suitable computing machine into laboratory work for the analysis of results, the rate at which results can be processed can be enormously increased. This leads to two valuable consequences. First, the mathematical expressions, which students often feel completely define a system, can be appreciated in numerical terms and furthermore techniques used which would otherwise be impossible. Secondly, time becomes available for students to make those qualitative value judgements so difficult to include in a technology based education. Furthermore the student is able to see the interrelationship between the different techniques used in control theory and how they relate to a practical situation. © 1974 by CAMET.",

The initial objective was specific support to undergraduate teaching, where computer applications were to feature in many different disciplines, but this support now extends to all users and the facilities cover a wide range of user needs, including advising, training and project support as well as hardware provision. Within this environment, the specific technique of line printer mapping using the CAMAP system has been developed.

		"abstract": "Teaching experience indicates that business school students typically have difficulty learning statistical methods and even more difficulty understanding the supporting theory. Various techniques and visual aids have been tried over the years in an attempt to stimulate interest and understanding of business statistics. Although somewhat helpful, these pre-computer teaching aids were inflexible and limited in usefulness. With the advent of the electronic computer the writer started experimenting.with the creation of various kinds of populations and random samples. Shewhart's classical fish bowl experiments were the first successful attempt to develop computer-assisted laboratory experiments. For the first time students in business statistics were able to create, 'see' and analyze populations; to select, analyze, and observe the characteristics of random samples. Experimental demonstrations of applied statistics in quality control classes followed. A master computer program called SPATS (statistical program to assist in teaching statistics) was developed by the writer to simplify the task of creating and analyzing populations and random samples. Instructions for SPATS may be learned quickly by students with no prior knowledge of programming. Successful use of SPATS has been made by both graduate and undergraduate business and economic students. Experimentation to improve its effectiveness is continuing. © 1974 by CAMET.",

		"abstract": "Motorola Inc., research climatologists, preservice teachers taking a science requirement, and students in a Title I middle school explored whether a new major urban lake increases local humidity and decreases quality of life in a community dependent on \"dry heat\" during summers. Analysis of automated climate data reveals that the urban lake is too small to increase humidity, a conclusion roughly consistent with student-gathered data--keeping in mind the difficulty of students in making reliable scientific measurements. Qualitative survey questions and interviews about the process revealed that elementary education majors learned they could generate excitement for authentic science and mathematics within themselves and within students through research experiences. Furthermore, the interaction introduced low income, minority middle schoolers to the idea that attending college is an option in their future. Thus, synergistic involvement of education majors and children in scientific research to generate excitement in science and mathematics is strongly encouraged.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the course developed by the authors for teaching mathematics to engineering undergraduates (Part I was published in Int. J. Math. Educ. Sci. Technol., 6, 361). The simultaneous treatment of the analytical, statistical, numerical and computer techniques which are relevant to a particular topic is discussed via three examples. A qualitative evaluation of its effectiveness is given. The role of ' case studies ' is considered and an example provided of the way such a study can be used. Three ' miniprojects ' of varying degrees of difficulty are described from the point of view of their educational value. Problems of implementing the course are discussed and suggestions are made as to possible future directions in which to move to keep the course up-to-date. This paper takes a critical look at the present state of mathematical education of engineers. It then suggests the improvements needed and proposes ways in which these can be implemented. In this part of the paper, attention is concentrated on identifying the problems and outlining a course developed by the authors in an attempt to meet the criteria for improvement. The paper is concluded by an examination of the refinements needed in this course to fully meet the required objectives. In Part II the problems in implementing such a course are discussed and examples given of the integrated approach it employs. Finally, developments to the course are suggested. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Many of the current applications of computer technology to education deal not so much with the quality of education as with its packaging and cost-effectiveness. A great deal of money and effort is being devoted to assembling computer dialogues out of standard course material, designing automatic individualized examinations or modifying homework problems to make use of computational facilities. At the same time, the relative superficiality of these methods when contrasted with the extravagant claims of their proponents has led many sensitive and sensible educators to regard computer aided instruction as a new and dangerous canonization of the most shallow and least humanistic aspects of education. This is unfortunate because undergraduate education can indeed be greatly enriched through the use of computers. To bring this about, however, will require that workers in educational technology stop worrying so much about designing languages for authoring computer dialogues and tailoring operating systems according to vague or narrow conceptions of educational use. Instead there must be a more serious concern with the significant ways in which computational resources can be used to improve not so much the delivery but rather the content of university courses. This paper outlines three broad areas in which the use of computers seems particularly promising. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "In this paper a framework is proposed for analyzing the deliberate actions taken by a teacher to participate in or influence the discourse in mathematics classrooms, and such actions are referred to as the teacher's discourse moves. This work synthesizes elements of several other discourse frameworks, including those of Richards, Sfard, Cobb, and Knuth and Peressini. Expanding on the improvisational dance metaphor of Heaton's, the framework views the teacher in the additional multiple roles as a Choreographer/Stage Manager/Director of classroom discourse. Several research applications of the discourse framework to collegiate mathematics education are discussed, including discourse around collaborative problem solving in Treisman Emerging Scholars workshops, a video-based study of a college-level geometry course for teachers, discourse in wireless networked classrooms, and the asynchronous discourse in an online statistics course.",

		"abstract": "The determinants for a family of matrices, occurring naturally in a course of statistics lectures, are investigated. Triangularization of the original matrices and column operations on their determinants were first tried, and then the expansion of the determinants to obtain difference equations. All to no avail. The computer was brought in to calculate a number of the determinants, and difference tables were constructed to suggest the forms of any formulae. These formulae were successfully obtained and a neat all-embracing expression conjectured. A connection with Pascal's triangle was noted, and when factored into primes, the determinantal values gave pretty patterns, thus motivating some interest in number theory. Finally, it was noted that the conjecture could be simply proved using a special case of an old, and almost forgotten result. The ' project' thus employed skills taught in several of the student's separate lecture courses, encouraging both versatility on the part of the student and a unification of his mathematical knowledge. It also teaches the salutary lesson of adequately searching the literature at an early stage of any investigation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "In designing a curriculum and its constituent teaching and learning strategies, it is important to consider the relative difficulties of the various sub-sections. As single measures of perceived difficulty (from teachers and learners) have been used in some studies, the efficacy of such readily available data has been studied in a tertiary level mathematics course for engineering students. Several approaches (parallel forms, comparison with achievement, and loaded questions) to the reliability and the validity of the measures of perceived difficulty are explored. The results indicate that the findings from such measures need to be interpreted with caution. This was particularly so during the first year of the course when the students have so recently come from a great variety of other mathematics learning environments in secondary schooling. The efficacy of the measures seems to be much improved in the second year of the course and the quite high correlation (0-753) between staff and student perceptions of topic difficulty probably does indicate a real congruence of ' mathematical socialization ' between both sets of participants in this mathematics curriculum. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Teachers of first-year college mathematics and engineering courses must often spend considerable time reviewing material originally taught in high school. Instead of this being a mere exercise in repetition, this article suggests that such a review can enrich and revitalize by unifying some of the subjects that need to be re-taught. In the example presented, the subjects in question are absolute values, graphs and solutions of equations, and domains of definition. These are unified by the problem of finding an analytic expression for a square and triangle and their interiors. In the course of the development, basic notions such as the additive property of areas and convexity are introduced. The approach presented in the article was tried with secondary school teachers participating in professional development workshops and with students at a technical college; the teachers and students responded enthusiastically to the material.",

It has been given at the Civil Service College, whose function, in the numeracy training of Civil Servants, is briefly described. It is hoped that teachers, in both secondary and tertiary education, will find the material of interest; and that it will stimulate some constructive and coordinated attempt to break down the divisive numeracy barrier, which prevents effective communication between the two camps of quantitative and qualitative thinkers. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe and assess materials and methods of teaching mathematics to undergraduate engineering students at West German Fachhochschulen (technical colleges of higher education). Two methods of instruction are outlined and assessed: (1) a combination of tutorials, written material and lectures and; (2) a combination of computer exercises, written material and lectures. Previous studies are reported which show some of the advantages of these two methods in terms of performance variables and attitudes. Two experiments were carried out to examine the effect of pre-instructional mathematics knowledge on performance. The first experiment compared the tutorial method to a straight lecture method; the second the computer method to the lecture method. Both experiments showed that students with low pre-instructional mathematics knowledge performed significantly better with the tutorial and computer supported methods. On the whole the dependency of performance on pre-instructional behaviour was less for both the tutorial and computer methods. Students’ attitudes towards the methods of instruction proved to be positive. The implications of the results are discussed and ways of improving the teaching methods are proposed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The day-by-day observations made by the experimenter during one of the activity-based classes indicate that college students can learn to discover some elementary probability models and formulas for themselves while working on probability experiments in small groups. Furthermore, the effects of sample size upon measures of central tendency and variability can be learned by students working on activities such as those developed for the experimental course in this study. Making guesses for the probability of events and checking guesses with a hand-held calculator seems to help college students to be more cautious about probability estimates, and helps to make them aware about some of their own misconceptions about probability. Small-group problem solving, keeping a log of all class work and activities, and investigating the misuses of statistics all appeared to have a positive effect upon college students' attitudes towards mathematics, as indicated in the questionnaires filled out by the subjects in the experimental sections. The present results of this study support the hypotheses of Kahneman and Tversky [10, 12] which claimed that combinatorially naive college students rely upon availability and representativeness to estimate the likelihood of events. Kahneman and Tversky were skeptical about the possibility of helping students to overcome their reliance upon availability and representativeness. The results on the posttest in this study suggest that the manner in which college students learn probability makes a difference in their ability to overcome misconceptions that arise from availability and representativeness. Mere exposure to probability concepts is not sufficient to overcome certain misconceptions of probability. Fischbein [9] notes that the \"synthesis between the necessary and the possible-which is the basis of probabilistic thinking-does not in fact take place spontaneously ....\" He claims that science education emphasizes only the deterministic aspect, and neglects the study of uncertainty. Thus peoples' intuition of probabilistic thinking is distorted by science education's emphasis on the necessary, and neglect of the possible. This experiment suggests that the course methodology and the teaching model used in an elementary probability course can help develop peoples' intuition for probabilistic thinking. A course in which students carry out experiments, work through activities to build their own probability models, and discover counting principles for themselves can help students to overcome their misconceptions about probability, and can help restore the synthesis between the necessary and the possible which is essential to probabilistic thinking. © 1977 D.

WebQuest, the name given to an inquiry-oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by learners is drawn from the Web, is being suggested as a means of enhancing learning. This paper investigates how WebQuests might be effective in developing the problem-posing skills of pre-service mathematics teachers. Fifty pre-service teachers from a College of Education took part in this research and, with data from both an achievement test in mathematics problem-posing and a mathematics problem-posing beliefs scale, the effectiveness of using WebQuests in learning problem-posing was measured. The results show significant differences between those pre-service teachers who experienced WebQuests and those who did not; illustrating that it is possible to change the beliefs of pre-service teachers toward the role of problem-posing in mathematics education.

		"abstract": "Computer ' glass boxes ' are computer programmes which are clearly written to embody a concept, procedure, or relationship. They are designed to make algorithmic structures accessible and comprehensible to the user. Advance organizers are prepared sets of concepts that are presented to the learner in advance of a body of material to be learned to ensure that concepts will be available for anchoring new ideas. This article proposes that computer glass boxes be employed as advance organizers in mathematics instruction to bring clarity and structural integration to mathematical, instructional, and cognitive structures important to the mastery of mathematical concepts. This type of structural integration can provide a workable solution to the problem of constructing curricula that take into account the learners' cognitive structures, while meeting the needs of the discipline's structure and the constraints of sound pedagogical structures. Mathematical structures, the organization of the discipline itself, are rarely clear to the learner, particularly in the early stages of mathematics instruction. A computer glass box programme for determining a greatest common divisor (GCD) can provide insight into mathematics structures, and need not be just a gimmick to teach an isolated bit of computation. The programme can show the relationships of subordinate concepts such as membership and intersection from set theory, and divisors and residue from number theory, to the subsuming concept of GCD. As well as revealing the structures of mathematics, glass boxes lend clarity and direction to the instructional structures teachers use in presenting topics. These programmes make clearer equivalence of concepts and elements of significant difference. This clarity makes possible instructional sequencing that reflects an awareness of similiarity in concepts presented, relevant features of previous concepts, and subsuming and related ideas. Finally, glass box programmes make transparent many of the cognitive structures necessitated by mathematical concepts. Some primitive APL (a programming language) functions relate directly to some lower-order cognitive processes that students should already have as part of their cognitive equipment. Computer glass boxes can indicate some of the higher-order cognitive processes students will need to thoroughly master topics in mathematics. The major implications of this discussion are that the mathematics discipline might be reconceptualized by teachers, and that instructional strategies might be optimized through the use of advance organizers in the form of computer glass box programmes. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "The importance of developing students' mathematical thinking is frequently highlighted in literature regarding the teaching and learning of mathematics. Despite this importance, most curricula and instructional activities for undergraduate mathematics fail to bring the learner beyond the mathematics. The purpose of this study was to enhance students' mathematical thinking by implementing a computer algebra system and active learning pedagogical approaches. students' mathematical thinking processes were analyzed while completing specific differential equations tasks based on posed prompts and questions and Instrumental Genesis. Data were collected from 37 engineering students in a public Malaysian university. This study used the descriptive and interpretive qualitative research design to investigate the students' perspectives of emerging mathematical understanding and approaches to learning mathematics in an undergraduate differential equations course. Results of this study concluded that students used a variety of mathematical thinking processes in a non-sequential manner. Additionally, the outcomes provide justification for continued use of technologies such as computer algebra systems in undergraduate mathematics courses and the need for further studies to uncover the various processes students utilize to complete specific mathematical tasks. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "If the process of education is about freeing pupils to enable them to take a more positive role in their learning, then the task of teachers becomes concerned with examining the ways in which this can happen. Over a two-year period at Belper High School we have offered the pupils opportunities to master our subject, to develop their confidence in their ability to cope, to 'grow tall' within and through the subject itself. Pupils across the full ability range are described in their sometimes faltering attempts at topics varying from solving simple equations to sophisticated number theory and loci problems. Actual teaching is demanding, tiring and sometimes confused with spurious and irrelevant activities. What we describe are sessions, observations and individual transformations which have generated, rather than dissipated, energy. This is a descriptive analysis of our methods and observations, offered in the hope that others will accept the challenge, endure the failures, examine the idiosyncracies and eventually experience the joys available to all involved in interactive teaching. © 1980 D.

However, it is often left out in many undergraduate courses as its implementation is deemed to be difficult. This is partly due to the perception that coding the method requires complex programming skills beyond the ability of a typical undergraduate. In this article, we present a simple and systematic way of implementing the boundary element method for solving the Laplace's equation using MATLAB, a numerical software package commonly used in undergraduate courses. The examples will demonstrate that a package such as MATLAB serves well in introducing as well as implementing the boundary element method. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",

For this purpose, a special teaching model was developed, implemented, and tested as part of the pre-service mathematics teacher education programs conducted in Israeli teacher colleges. The conclusion of the study is that application of the model, through which the pre-service teachers gain experience of and are exposed to authentic investigative proportional reasoning tasks with incorporation of theory (reading and analyzing relevant research reports) and practice, leads to a significant positive change in the pre-service teachers' mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge.

This paper introduces the emerging discipline of statistics education and considers its role in the development of these important skills. The paper begins with information on the growing importance of statistics in today's society, schools and colleges, summarizes unique challenges students face as they learn statistics, and makes a case for the importance of collaboration between mathematicians and statisticians in preparing teachers to teach students how to understand and reason about data. We discuss the differences and interrelations between statistics and mathematics, recognizing that mathematics is the discipline that has traditionally included instruction in statistics. We conclude with an argument that statistics should be viewed as a bridge between mathematics and science and should be taught in both disciplines.",

		"abstract": "Consistent with international trends, an emergent interest in inquiry-based science teaching and learning in K-12 schools is also occurring in China. This study investigates the possibilities for and the barriers to enactment of inquiry-based science education in Chinese schools. Altogether 220 Chinese science teachers, science teacher educators and researchers (primarily from the field of chemistry education) participated in this study in August 2001. Participants represented 13 cities and provinces in China. We administered two questionnaires, one preceding and one following a 3-hour presentation by a US science educator and researcher about inquiry-based teaching and learning theories and practices. In each of three sites in which the study was conducted (Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing), questionnaires were administered, and four representative participants were interviewed. Our coding and analysis of quantifiable questionnaire responses (using a Likert scale), of open-ended responses, and of interview transcripts revealed enthusiastic interest in incorporating inquiry-based teaching and learning approaches in Chinese schools. However, Chinese educators face several challenges: (a) the national college entrance exam needs to align with the goals of inquiry-based teaching; (b) systemic reform needs to happen in order for inquiry-based science to be beneficial to students, including a change in the curriculum, curriculum materials, relevant resources, and teacher professional development; (c) class size needs to be reduced; and (d) an equitable distribution of resources in urban and rural schools needs to occur. © 2004 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

This article revisits concept image in the context of research on undergraduate students’ understanding of the derivative which regards the context of learning as paramount. The literature, mainly on concept image and concept definition, is considered before outlining the research study, the calculus courses and results which inform considerations of concept image. Section 6 addresses three themes: students’ developing concept images of the derivative; the relationship between teaching and students’ developing concept images; students’ developing concept images and their departmental affiliation. The conclusion states that studies of undergraduates’ concept images should not ignore their departmental affiliations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from staff teaching undergraduate mathematics. The study shows that many staff members feel that chalkboards are still more suitable than technology for teaching mathematics. This finding supports the idea of a strong subject culture. Age does not emerge as a determinant for preference of either technology or the chalkboard, although gender and academic qualifications do. Subject culture is strongly rooted under the male members of staff, while female staff members feel more positive towards the use of technology in teaching. Use of chalkboards has decreased significantly over the past 10 years, while the use of modern technologies has increased accordingly. Teaching of large groups has necessitated the use of technology in the classroom. Despite the strong subject culture, a shift in attitude towards technology use in teaching is noticed and there is a definite trend of moving towards using new technologies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "The relevancy of linear algebra (LA) in different areas and also the difficulties faced by undergraduate engineering students studying this content are well known. Grounded on this premise, we aimed at articulating papers related to the teaching and learning of LA in engineering undergraduate programs through a mapping of the main investigations on the teaching and learning of LA carried out since 2000, by the Work Group Mathematical Education in Higher Education, associated with the Brazilian Society of Mathematical Education (SBEM), together with work produced between 2007 and 2018 by other Latin American studies on this subject in Mathematical Education societies with a representation similar to that of SBEM. We focused specifically on the link between the content of LA and that studied in specific courses. Methodologically, we followed the principles of Content Analysis and, based on a body of eight papers, we noted the following: (1) examples of situations through which it is possible to establish links between LA and contexts of engineering; (2) the role played out by the Technologies of Information and Communication (TIC) in the implementation of these links; (3) the importance of the concepts of eigenvalue and eigenvector in the resolution of problems of engineering; (4) the need to facilitate the mobilization of students to use different registers of semiotic representation, while working with the concepts of LA; (5) the importance of reflecting upon the (initial and continued) training of teachers who teach LA in engineering and ultimately, (6) the use of links between LA and contexts of engineering as an element of motivation for students and for their recognition of when to use them.

In this note, the condition for one root of a cubic equation to be the negative reciprocal of another one is obtained. Given that the coefficients a, b, c of the cubic equation are in arithmetical or geometrical progression, further conditions are deived for one root to be the negative reciprocal of another. These results provide useful means for checking calculated roots of cubic equations and could serve the needs of teachers and students of Mathematical Sciences in tertiary institutions when the solution of cubic equations are first studied.",

		"abstract": "Motivated by work done with pre-teachers of mathematics in a problem-solving course, this paper shows how computing technologies, including a spreadsheet and Maple, facilitate an informal journey into a hidden aspect of the formal content of the pre-college curriculum dealing with the arithmetic of partitions. By using three problems from different grade levels within a state curriculum as an example, the paper suggests that a deeper perspective on seemingly disconnected problem-solving contexts may serve as a powerful didactical tool in helping teachers to appreciate mathematics and its pedagogy as an integrated whole. The connection of the hidden aspect of the curriculum to the concept of mathematical play is also explored. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Design-based research studies are conducted as iterative implementation-analysis-modification cycles, in which emerging theoretical models and pedagogically plausible activities are reciprocally tuned toward each other as a means of investigating conjectures pertaining to mechanisms underlying content teaching and learning. Yet this approach, even when resulting in empirically effective educational products, remains under-conceptualized as long as researchers cannot be explicit about their craft and specifically how data analyses inform design decisions. Consequentially, design decisions may appear arbitrary, design methodology is insufficiently documented for broad dissemination, and design practice is inadequately conversant with learning-sciences perspectives. One reason for this apparent under-theorizing, I propose, is that designers do not have appropriate constructs to formulate and reflect on their own intuitive responses to students’ observed interactions with the media under development. Recent socio-cultural explication of epistemic artifacts as semiotic means for mathematical learners to objectify presymbolic notions (e.g., Radford, Mathematical Thinking and Learning 5(1): 37–70, ) may offer design-based researchers intellectual perspectives and analytic tools for theorizing design improvements as responses to participants’ compromised attempts to build and communicate meaning with available media. By explaining these media as potential semiotic means for students to objectify their emerging understandings of mathematical ideas, designers, reciprocally, create semiotic means to objectify their own intuitive design decisions, as they build and improve these media. Examining three case studies of undergraduate students reasoning about a simple probability situation (binomial), I demonstrate how the semiotic approach illuminates the process and content of student reasoning and, so doing, explicates and possibly enhances design-based research methodology.

		"abstract": "In order to learn problem solving, students must solve many problems. Cooperative problem solving in small groups is helpful both to students and to the instructor. When this approach is used, the class is divided into groups with four or five members apiece. Using whatever cooperative methods the group chooses, each group produces a proof, a solution to a challenging problem or puzzle, or the solutions to a set of problems, either in or out of class. When all members of a group have agreed that it is correct, a single written paper is submitted to the instructor. Students in my abstract algebra, logic, and number theory classes, who spent a semester doing group problem solving, were particularly appreciative of the opportunity they had to discover new strategies, solutions, and perspectives from their peers. Students in my elementary classes in calculus and college algebra and trigonometry reviewed their homework assignments in small groups. They were exceptionally positive in evaluating their group experiences. Large numbers of them found help from their peers beneficial, developed better understanding of the work, and had greater incentive to do their assignments. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "During the fifties and sixties in Chile many mathematics graduates of Pedagogical Institutes became university instructors rather than high school teachers as intended. In the late sixties Masters level programmes began giving more advanced training for university mathematics instructors. A 'modern' mathematics curriculum including computer science was introduced in the high schools. The first significant attempt to adapt the training of Chilean high school mathematics teachers to the new academic and social realities was begun in 1976 at the State Technical University with the cooperation of Teachers College, Columbia University, and the support of the Organization of American States. The four-year programme leads to Licenciatura (Bachelors) in Mathematics and Computer Education. All courses are taught by faculty members of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. The three basic areas of instruction are mathematics, computer science, and mathematics education. Funds provided by the O.A.S. have helped to make possible the development of curricular materials in Spanish, and the acquisition of computing and video tape equipment. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

A teaching strategy is developed and illustrated by drawing on classroom experiences of formulation. The illustrations cover student responses to problem and subproblem identification, and detailed responses to formulation of the three 'realproblems': use of a U-tube accelerometer in cars, laser beams in drilling holes, and speed-wobble in motorcycles. Suggestions for further research and experimentation are made, particularly in linking formulation with problem solving strategies. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

The study reported here considered questions relating to the mathematical appreciation of successful students at both senior secondary (university entrance) and tertiary level. The tertiary students were graduates embarking upon a post-graduate course of teacher-training. It was found that response patterns were stable across a variety of institutions, geographical regions (Australian States), and education systems. Mathematical malfunctions present among secondary graduates were found to exist in substantially the same proportions among the graduate teacher trainees. It was found that the type of understanding sought in this study was not enhanced merely by taking more mathematics courses. The problem of recycling of attitudes and mathematical misconceptions within the secondary teaching structure is addressed, and the question of the approach to the study of mathematics at both secondary and tertiary level is raised as a matter of continuing concern. © 1982 D.

Results show that the three major contributors to students’ learning, arranged in decreasing order of importance are: (1) the class textbook; (2) the teacher; and (3) friends and relatives serving as tutors. A good teacher serves as the main provider of students’ knowledge. If the teacher is poor, the class textbook becomes the primary source for students’ learning and the weight of tutoring increases significantly. Students in more advanced courses use more textbook and tutorial help from mathematicians and less help from friends and relatives than do students in the first courses of the calculus sequence. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Little hard evidence exists to support the contention that college remedial mathematics programs do indeed help students remove or remedy their deficiencies. The purpose of this study was to determine for remedial students the differential effects of two instructional modes centering around, respectively, (1) small-group instructional processes (experimental), and (2) lecturedemonstration processes (control). These effects were investigated in relation to (1) academic achievement, (2) attitude toward mathematics, and (3) sex difference. A total of 171 subjects participated in the main study. A 2 × 2 factorial analysis of covariance was employed to test the main hypotheses. Data from attitude and achievement scores were subjected to ranking and the Kendall tau (T) test of association was employed. The results of this study indicated the smallgroup instructional procedures had a significantly greater positive impact (P<0-001) on achievement in arithmetic, elementary algebra, and combined arithmetic and algebra than the lecture-dmonstration method. Sex difference, in favor of females, was significant only in regard to algebra (P< 0-002) and the combined content (P<0001). A general conclusion of this study is that it is feasible-given certain boundary conditions—to develop a remedial mathematics course whose main instructional focus is on students working in small groups. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Examples are given which illustrate how several errors made in translating problems into mathematical terminology derive from misinterpreting problems.

		"abstract": "Mathematics and science tutors from the School of Education, University of East Anglia have since 1978 been involved in INSET programmes which includes meeting teachers and children in their own schools. Such school-based in-service work is demanding for all concerned. It involves making sensitive judgements, often instantly, about relationships between teachers, pupils, heads, and LEA staff. This is especially so in mathematics and science where so many people feel inadequate. Tutors involved in teacher training should consider their professional experience lacking if it does not include recent school-based inservice education because the work brings a new dimension to courses which are based at Schools or Colleges of Education. This paper gives a brief account of the development of school-based work in small rural schools in Suffolk and more recently in Norfolk. Professional expertise in teaching was encouraged through considering the problems of transfer of pupils from one school to another. The question is also asked whether attempting to interrelate mathematics and science in the primary school is desirable. The differing attitudes towards the two disciplines make any connections difficult, but the time is right to attempt to cross the subject boundaries and to improve children's learning in these vital subjects in the process. However, there are problems. These need investigation in the schools and a way forward is to introduce a research programme which is school-based, connects mathematics and science in mutually beneficial ways, and which can not only maintain innovation in the pilot schools but also be readily available generally for all primary schools, rural or urban, small or large. It seems likely that the production and use of video cassettes could play a major role in the process. School-based mathematics and science require different approaches. Can advances be made by attempting to interrelate work in these subjects?. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Marked sex differences, in favour of boys, are noted and discussed. Three different procedures for comparing item responses of younger and older groups are employed, leading to the conclusion that younger and older students respond to SAT items in qualitatively different ways.

		"abstract": "For the last few years, the author has been part of a team developing a mathematics course for students most of whom are women, many of whom are black and all of whom are attempting to gain entry to a teacher-training course by successfully completing a one year re-entry course. It is a requirement that teacher-training students should have attained a suitable standard in mathematics. Further Education colleges where re-entry courses are sited have a sad history of student failure in mathematics. The theoretical environment in which the development of this course took place is described in order to place the course in context. In particular, attention is drawn to the re-definition of mathematics which encourages student enquiry and experimentation in order to establish a basis for understanding the subject, and to the teaching/learning model which creates an environment of respect and confidence. The roles of students and staff in a learning environment of this kind are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the attitudes and feelings of the students and the effects on their expectations. © 1987 D. Reidel Publishing Company.",

		"abstract": "In an introductory abstract algebra course, the emphasis is on developing abstract properties of groups, not on finding applications of group theory. Therefore, students are generally unaware of the wide application of groups to other areas of mathematics and science. Here we provide the student with an introduction to a variety of concrete uses of groups. In order to provide a link between the examples, we concentrate on just one group, the four element Klein 4-group. Instances of this group are given inside other mathematical areas as well as in molecular classification in chemistry and in coding theory in computer science. This paper could be used as a one-hour lecture in an introductory abstract algebra class: no subject is dealt with in detail but references are given for further study. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

While investigating a problem concerning Pythagorean number triples in computer science, students (in the upper secondary level) discovered number theoretical conjectures of amazing depth, which turned out to be classical results in mathematical literature. However, a graphical output provoked a geometrical interpretation that seemed new. In a second step, new results concerning the asymptotic distribution of certain Pythagorean triples were found.

The questionnaire measured; (i) the student's attitude towards statistics, (ii) the way in which they learned statistics, (iii) the student's intention to pursue further statistics training, and (iv) the perceived usefulness of statistics in their professions. It was found that the learning of statistics would be enhanced by smaller tutorial groups, and more exposure to computer printouts to assist in interpretation of results. An emphasis on the understanding of statistics presented in journal articles should be a priority. It was also apparent that the more computer and research experience the student had prior to commencing the course, the greater the likelihood of a positive attitude towards statistics. However, both undergraduate and postgraduate students indicated that they would not enrol in an advanced biostatistics course, but would rather consult a statistician when necessary. Suggestions for more effective statistical teaching for health sciences students are also discussed. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Variables that may affect success in mathematical estimation in preservice elementary teachers were studied. A multiple regression analysis was performed in order to predict success on a 25 problem estimation test. Subjects' answer to the question, \"Are you good at math?\" was the best predictor of success on the estimation test. Other important variables were college grade point average, years of study of mathematics, and enjoyment of mathematics. Not only were average mathematics grades not related to estimation score, but they were negatively correlated to estimation score. Half the subjects saw problems in an applied format, and half saw the same problems in a computational format. The number of subjects answering problems correctly in the application format was significantly greater than the number of subjects answering questions correctly in the computational format. This result was contradictory to results usually found for finding exact answers with pencil and paper. A reason for greater success on problems in the application format may be related to the fact that the applied problems involved money, a very relevant type of problem in which to quickly estimate an answer. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

Consequently, obvious and unavoidable steps were adopted by government for the purposes of ensuring the realization of this functional literacy element in the system. One such step bordered on the revision/restructuring of school curricula at the appropriate levels. In this paper, we sought to examine to what extent that teacher preparation at the tertiary levels reflected the attainment of objectives for mathematics education at the senior secondary level. This report centred essentially on the Imo, Bendel and Rivers State School Systems, the result of which guided us to the conclusion that vital elements of teacher preparation seemed lacking in the context of ensuring thorough grounding in mathematics of pupils at the senior secondary level. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",

		"abstract": "I lay a new theoretical framework across my own lecturing in order to understand what is happening. On the one hand, this is a test of the framework. On the other, I gain insights into both better practices and better course design. The framework constructs undergraduate teaching as the interaction between the discipline and the university pedagogical context. Overlaying this are three levels of teaching intent: pragmatic, epistemic, and heuristic. The resulting framework supports my growing understanding of lecturing practice. It also proves useful in analysing three characteristics of university mathematics: student responsibility for learning; enculturation of the discipline of mathematics; and the tyranny of examples. The framework is a tool for redesigning courses and developing delivery formats that are likely to enhance student learning and behavior objectives of undergraduate mathematics. However, the analysis shows a deficiency of the framework in its paucity of attention to student learning in a university context. Extending the framework in this way is the next task. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

A description is given of the way in which the author has applied this principle to his undergraduates using as a vehicle the example of ventilation of a lecture room. The advantages of employing an example which is realistic and yet which can be tackled satisfactorily using relatively simple mathematics are argued. While this approach has been well received by the students, the pressures on the mathematics lecturer to reduce contact hours puts him in a dilemma: if time is found for modelling then something must be lost from the current syllabus.

		"abstract": "This study was undertaken to explore pre-service teachers’ understanding of injections and surjections. There were 54 pre-service teachers specialising in the teaching of Mathematics in Grades 10–12 curriculum who participated in the project. The concepts were covered as part of a real analysis course at a South African university. Questionnaires based on an initial genetic decomposition of the concepts of surjective and injective functions were administered to the 54 participants. Their written responses, which were used to identify the mental constructions of these concepts, were analysed using an APOS (action-process-object-schema) framework and five interviews were carried out. The findings indicated that most participants constructed only Action conceptions of bijection and none demonstrated the construction of an Object conception of this concept. Difficulties in understanding can be related to students’ lack of construction of the concepts of functions and sets that are a prerequisite to working with bijections. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

Theoretically grounded in Schoenfeld's resources, orientations, and goals (ROG) model of teacher action, a group met regularly to discuss both the video excerpts of themselves lecturing along with written pre- and post-lecture statements of their 'ROGs'. We found evidence of improved teaching performance but more interestingly, identified key aspects of our practice and of undergraduate mathematics that received repeated attention and developed further theoretical insight into lecturer behaviour in mathematics. The trial has been successful enough to be expanded into further groups that now constitute a professional development culture within our department. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This was done in comparison to the use of a traditional procedural approach for instruction on the same topic. Data were gathered from a common unit assessment that included procedural and conceptual questions. Results demonstrate that small changes in instruction focused on quantitative reasoning can lead to significant differences in students' ability to demonstrate conceptual understanding compared to a procedural approach. The results also indicate that a quantitative reasoning approach does not appear to diminish students' procedural skills, but that additional work is needed to understand how to best support students' understanding of linear relationships.",

		"abstract": "Drawing on in-depth interviews with the third year students at a New Zealand university, we explore the ways in which students speak about studying mathematics, their relationship with the subject and how this has developed over time. These interviews were conducted as part of a project looking at undergraduate mathematics from the perspective of lecturers, students, and interactions in lectures, and funded by the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative in New Zealand. We use the work of Gee [Identity as an analytic lens for research in education, Rev. Res. Educ. 25 (2000), pp. 99?125] to tease out some discourses of mathematics that frame students? participation in the subject, and show that notions of 'natural ability', and of being passionate about the study of mathematics for its own sake, dominate the narratives of mathematics students. In developing this position, we turn to psycho-social theorists such as Hollway and Jefferson [Doing Qualitative Research Differently: Free Association, Narrative and the Interview Method, Sage, London, 1997] so as to question the? face-value? meanings of these narratives and to argue that students? choices have less to do with rational decision making than with constructing identities that protect vulnerable aspects of themselves. Finally, we develop the metaphor of a 'maths club', which we feel captures something of the culture of mathematics and students' orientations towards the subject. This metaphor also allows us to raise questions about widening participation in mathematics. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This paper is devoted to the investigation of students' understanding and handling of examples in the framework of an example-based introductory mathematics undergraduate course. The plan of the course included a wide use of graphs in standard lectures, tutoring sessions as well as in examinations. This study deals with the notion of increasing function, which has been introduced by means of both the standard definition and a range of examples and non-examples, most often conveyed through graphs. We have analysed students' interpretations of the notion of increasing function as they applied them in a set of written examination tests. The data gathered have been completed by a number of interviews of students whose answers were difficult to interpret. The outcomes underline the importance of linguistic and semiotic competence and suggest that the design of innovative teaching paths should take care of the linguistic and semiotic skills needed to handle the representations involved.

		"abstract": "Our students' experience with construction problems in plane geometry is usually is very limited, since this type of problems is not included in the Israeli school curriculum. In view of specific features of the computerised tools, it seems almost obvious to consider applying new methods in geometry teaching based on them in teaching isometric transformations and construction problems. In the current research, we are relating to the students of the undergraduate education program for secondary schools mathematics teachers who participated simultaneously in an advanced course in plane geometry and in the course on computer usage in mathematics teaching. We refer to two sub-groups of students differing in their level of geometrical thought, and to two different levels of problems as we classified them: simpler ones, and more complicated ones. We observed different approaches towards computer usage concerning these types of problems among the students of the two subgroups, and investigated the appropriate computer usage for teaching and learning these types of problems and their solutions. In particular, we found that a student should be introduced to the computerised tools simultaneously with the theoretical part of the course and experience studying the course using these tools. As a result, we have come up with a new method of teaching these issues. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "• In interviews, 17 teachers validated the same arguments in two contexts. • Participants were primed as secondary teacher and university mathematics student. • Differences in validations can be explained by construct of position. • Position should be considered in both research design and teacher education. Recent research shows the promise of using tasks that situate mathematics in a pedagogical context in courses for secondary teachers. Such tasks can engage teachers in connecting undergraduate mathematics and secondary mathematics teaching, even when pedagogical knowledge is not needed to solve the task. We examine the phenomenon that the presence of pedagogical context appears to change the work of a mathematical task. We presented 17 practicing secondary teachers with the same set of arguments to validate, first in the context of teaching secondary mathematics, and then in the context of a university mathematics course. We argue that the construct of social positioning – as a student or teacher – explains differences in secondary teachers' validations as well as the problem of disconnection between undergraduate mathematics and secondary teaching.

		"abstract": "As part of a study on the effects of teaching with a Modified Moore Method (MMM), a survey containing 20 items from Schoenfeld's (1989) investigation of attitudes and beliefs about mathematics was administered to students in undergraduate precalculus classes. The study included one section of precalculus taught with an MMM, a student-centered and inquiry-based teaching method, and two sections taught using traditional lecture methods. The survey was administered one week into the semester, following the drop/add date, and during the last week of classes. In this paper, we discuss the findings of the attitudes and beliefs portions of the survey and correlations with scores on a common final exam. We looked for differences between the MMM and traditional sections as well as gender differences. There were only a few differences in the attitudes and beliefs among the students, although there were more changes for females than males and all the significant differences were positive. The correlation between attitudes and beliefs and final exam scores was much stronger in the traditionally taught classes than in the MMM class. When separated by gender, only the reported attitudes and beliefs of the females in the traditional class significantly correlated with final exam scores. (Contains 4 tables.)",

		"abstract": "The study identified two dimensions of teacher self-efficacy and practices and five dimensions of students' mathematics self-efficacy and sought to determine the extent to which teacher characteristics and practices can enhance secondary school students' self-efficacy. Data were collected from 13,173 students in 193 teachers' classrooms from 141 schools in the 10 districts of Lake Victoria Region of Kenya. Two-level hierarchical linear model revealed that teachers' frequent use of mathematics homework, their level of interest and enjoyment of mathematics, as well as their ability and competence in teaching mathematics were found to play a key role in promoting students' mathematics self-efficacy. Teachers' ability and competence in teaching were also found to be effective in narrowing the gender gap in students' self-confidence and competence in mathematics. The study recommends that teacher training colleges emphasize such teacher practices and values in order to enhance students' mathematics self-efficacy, reduce their level of anxiety and fear of mathematics, and consequently, enhance their achievement in mathematics. Professional development opportunities should also be made available to in-service teachers to continually update their knowledge and skills and develop new strategies for teacher effectiveness. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "In the United States, undergraduates-regardless of their field of study-generally must complete a mathematics course to meet breadth-of-study requirements. This report is aimed at providing a research foundation for practical efforts to improve teaching and learning in such college mathematics service courses (e.g., college algebra, liberal arts mathematics, business calculus). The case participant, Professor Kale, was a PhD mathematician with 12 years of college teaching experience, 6 years as a graduate student and 6 years after the doctorate. He and students in both of his classes agreed to the daily video recording of their meetings for an entire semester. Through constant-comparative analysis of videos and extensive interviews with Professor Kale, as well as brief interviews with his students and other members of the department, we derived a description of discursive patterns in Kale's classes. We conclude with possible implications for future work in college mathematics service course research and teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Abstract: Four instructors used authentic research projects and related curriculum materials when teaching elementary statistics in secondary and undergraduate settings. Projects were authentic in that students selected their own variables, defined their own research questions, and collected and analyzed their own data. Classes using these projects were considered treatment groups in the study. Student outcomes measured were content knowledge, perceived usefulness of statistics, and statistics self-efficacy. These outcomes were compared with those of students taught by the same instructors in prior terms without authentic projects (the control groups). Although all three outcomes increased for the treatment group in both settings, simple t-tests indicated that these gains were not statistically significant. Variables were identified as potential factors mediating the effects of treatment, and multivariate and univariate models were then used to examine treatment, setting, instructor effects, and student achievement level as variables jointly contributing to these three outcomes. Follow-up analyses suggested that some treatment effects were significant in more restricted contexts (e.g., in certain settings for certain types of students). The models also suggest multiple significant interactions among treatment, setting, individual instructor, and student achievement level, particularly on affective outcomes.

		"abstract": "The teaching of mathematics in Singapore continues, in most cases, to follow a traditional model. While this traditional approach has many advantages, it does not always adequately prepare students for University-level mathematics, especially applied mathematics. In particular, it does not cultivate the ability to deal with non-routine problems, which is an essential virtue for any practitioner of mathematical modelling (MM). Here, we argue that this inability to handle non-routine problems is the principal reason for the serious difficulties experienced by Singaporean students who encounter MM at the tertiary level in Singapore universities. A survey was conducted, primarily to understand the difficulties facing the preliminary batch of first-year undergraduate engineering students doing a course in MM using differential equations (DEs) and linear algebra. Our work is motivated by concerns that the novelty of this course in the Singaporean context could lead to difficulties for these students. Students' abilities in attempting novel modelling-type problems, the techniques they employ in solving such problems, their comments on the course and expectations of their lecturers and tutors are being probed. We present our analyses of the survey results and discuss the implications for future work. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "This paper gives an account of a teaching experiment on absolute value inequalities, whose aim was to identify characteristics of an approach that would realize the potential of the topic to develop theoretical thinking in students enrolled in prerequisite mathematics courses at a large, urban North American university. The potential is demonstrated in an epistemological analysis of the topic. It is also shown that this potential is not realized in the way the topic is presently taught in prerequisite mathematics courses. Three groups of students enrolled in such courses were each exposed to one of three approaches we conceived for teaching the topic, labeled the procedural (PA), the theoretical (TA), and the visual (VA) approaches. The design of the three lectures was constrained by institutional characteristics of college-level courses, and informed by epistemological and didactical analyses of the topic. It was found that following the VA lecture, which proposed two equally valid mathematical techniques (graphical and analytic), one of which could be used to test the validity of results obtained by the other, students were more likely to engage in some aspects of theoretical thinking. They displayed more reflective and systemic thinking than other groups, and dealt more effectively with the logical intricacies of absolute value inequalities. VA students appeared to have a synthetic grasp of the inequalities, and a flexibility of thought not displayed by PA and TA students. However, without sufficient attention to tasks not easily solved by graphical means, VA approach provided students with a way to avoid the challenges of systemic and analytic thinking, some of which were more apparent in TA students. PA students expectedly behaved more as procedural knowers, but we saw interesting examples of engagement with theoretical thinking while dealing with the procedures proposed in the PA lecture.

We describe the design of the material needed to produce the animations: (1) identifying an instructional situation, (2) identifying norms of the contract that are key in that situation, (3) selecting or creating a scenario that illustrates those norms, (4) proposing alternative scenarios that instantiate breaches of those norms, and (5) anticipating justifications or rebuttals for the breaches that could be found in instructors' reactions. We illustrate the interplay of contextual and theoretical elements as we make decisions and state hypothesis about the situation that will be prototyped. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

One of the key variables in the school to university transition is the teacher/lecturer, and here, we deal with the data analysing secondary teachers' and tertiary lecturers' responses to four mathematics questions. Elsewhere, we consider knowledge, preparedness, teaching style, etc., but this article tracks the ability to use mathematical procedures. We hypothesize that this is a function of what we pay attention to, as described in Mason's discipline of noticing. The results reveal that many teachers and lecturers fail to notice the necessary conditions for problems that imply that procedures are not always applicable.

		"abstract": "Many mathematics education researchers have suggested that asking learners to generate examples of mathematical concepts is an effective way of learning about novel concepts. To date, however, this suggestion has limited empirical support. We asked undergraduate students to study a novel concept by either tackling example generation tasks or reading worked solutions to these tasks. Contrary to suggestions in the literature, we found no advantage for the example generation group on subsequent proof production tasks. From a second study, we found that undergraduate students overwhelmingly adopt a trial and error approach to example generation and suggest that different example generation strategies may result in different learning gains. We conclude by arguing that the teaching strategy of example generation is not yet understood well enough to be a viable pedagogical recommendation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Issues related to college access and the need for a pipeline of STEM teachers, provided the impetus for the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR) to issue a call for Ohio universities to design pre-college experiences for high school students with three major goals in mind: (a) improvement in mathematics, science, or foreign language learning; (b) increased attraction to careers as teachers of these subjects; and (c) increased familiarity and readiness for college admission to study these subjects. Through funding provided by an OBR grant we designed and implemented a summer immersion program for high school juniors and seniors in order to meet the needs of this call. Students with self-reported interests in teaching mathematics or science spent two weeks on two environmentally different universities, Miami University and the University of Cincinnati, as a means to expose them to different campus climates while building a greater since of belonging, both culturally and academically. They also earned three PreCalculus credits through rigorous college-coursework. Within this manuscript we describe the program, report pre- and post-test data analyses, provide insights into students' perceptions of the college experience, and reflect on our own lessons learned.

		"abstract": "Two complementary processes involved in mathematical modelling are mathematising a realistic situation and applying a mathematical technique to a given realistic situation. We present and analyse work from two undergraduate students and two secondary school teachers who engaged in both processes during a mathematical modelling task that required them to find a graphical representation of an anti-derivative of a function. When determining the value of the anti-derivative as a measure of height, they mathematised the situation to develop a mathematical model, and attempted to apply their knowledge of integration that they had previously learned in class. However, the participants favoured their more primitive mathematised knowledge over the formal knowledge they tried to apply. We use these results to argue for calculus instruction to include more modelling activities that promote mathematising rather than the application of knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Research results indicate that high school students prefer verbal proofs to other formats. We found it interesting and important to examine the position of secondary school teachers with regard to verbal proofs. Fifty high school teachers were asked to prove various elementary number theory statements, to write correct and incorrect proofs that students may use, and to evaluate given justifications to statements from elementary number theory. While all the participants provided correct proofs to the statements, our findings indicate that teachers are not aware of students' preference for verbal justifications. Also, about half of the teachers rejected correct verbal justifications. They claimed that these justifications lacked generality and are mere examples. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

The study was conducted in large lecture classes. A pre- and post-Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism was conducted with just fewer than 700 Thai undergraduate science students, before and after being taught the concepts, in three academic years. For 2005 and 2006, overall, the students had a better understanding of concepts associated with electricity, but a majority of the students seemed not to understand magnetism after the teaching. Drawing on these findings, the teaching sequences of the magnetism topic were developed, and then implemented in the academic year 2007. The teaching sequences included demonstrations and visuals to help students infer rules and theories for themselves (inductive method). In addition, interactive notes, information on historical science discoveries about magnetic phenomenon, questions, student discussions, and magnetism problems were used to support student learning during lectures. Students in the academic year 2007 performed significantly better after the teaching. In addition, the students had a positive perception towards the teaching sequences, which allowed them to be involved more actively during lectures. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: Though written accounts of collegiate mathematics teaching exist (e.g., mathematicians’ reflections and analyses of learning and teaching in innovative courses), research on collegiate teachers’ actual classroom teaching practice is virtually non-existent. We advance this claim based on a thorough review of peer-reviewed journals where scholarship on collegiate mathematics teaching is published. To frame this review, we distinguish between instructional activities and teaching practice and present six categories of published scholarship that consider collegiate teaching but are not descriptive empirical research on teaching practice. Empirical studies can reveal important differences among teachers’ thinking and actions, promote discussions of practice, and support learning about teaching. To support such research, we developed a preliminary framework of cognitively oriented dimensions of teaching practice based on our review of empirical research on pre-college and college teaching.

How can the use of CAS widen the range of students' cognitive strategies and affect pragmatic, heuristic, and epistemic thinking schemes? How can CAS enhance metacognition and cognitive self- efficacy? How can CAS-enhanced curricula benefit from the examination of various cognitive strategies? How can the examination of CAS-related cognitive strategies assist modularisation of topics and thickening the \"knowledge-representation network\"?

		"abstract": "Images, diagrams, and other forms of visualization are playing increasingly important roles in molecular life science teaching and research, both for conveying information and as conceptual tools, transforming the way we think about the events and processes the subject covers. This study examines how upper secondary and tertiary students interpret visualizations of transport through the cell membrane in the form of a still image and an animation. Twenty upper secondary and five tertiary students were interviewed. In addition, 31 university students participated in a group discussion and answered a questionnaire regarding the animation. A model, based on variation theory, was then tested as a tool for distinguishing between what is expected to be learned, what is present in the visualizations, and what is actually learned by the students. Three critical features of the ability to visualize biomolecular processes were identified from the students' interpretations of the animation: the complexity of biomolecular processes, the dynamic and random nature of biomolecular interactions, and extrapolation between 2D and 3D. The results of this study support the use of multiple representations to achieve different learning goals. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2009.",

		"abstract": "Many undergraduate students have difficulty writing mathematical proofs even though this skill is important for the development of future teachers and those who may be involved in instruction or training as a graduate student or supervisor. In addition, research indicates that mathematics majors and secondary education mathematics majors possess little ability to determine whether arguments are valid proofs. Asking students to validate proofs using specific activities may not only help undergraduates develop the ability to validate proofs, but also may help increase their own proof writing abilities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of proof validation on the ability to write proofs. Two sections of abstract algebra were the focus of a 'guided research' study - one section was taught using a weekly proof validation activity and the other was taught as a control group. Data analysis revealed that the validation group significantly outscored the control group on items involving proof writing on the final exam. Results of the proof validation activities are also presented. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

This way of mobilization can be featured as a set of collective indisciplinary problematizations occurring in a series of student investigations. Mobilizing practices of mathematics culture are the object of these investigations. These practices are performed by different communities both constituted by and constituent of different human activities. In the second part of this paper, we will discuss our way of mobilizing histories, contrasting it with the theoretical perspective of expansive learning, just as it has been defended by Yrjö Engeström, in his article Non scolae sed vitae discimus-towards overcoming the encapsulation of school learning. We will also attempt to highlight the role which this researcher has attributed to history in his model of expansive learning, a perspective based on the current research on activity theory. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.",

		"abstract": "The emergence of new computing technologies in the second half of the twentieth century brought about new potentials and promised the rapid transformation of the teaching and learning of mathematics. However, despite the vast investments in technology resources for schools and universities, the realities of schooling and the complexities of technology-equipped environments resulted in a much slower integration process than was predicted in the 1980s. Hence researchers, together with teachers and mathematicians, began examining and reflecting on various aspects of technology-assisted teaching and learning and on the causes of slow technology integration. Studies highlighted that as technology becomes increasingly available in schools, teachers' beliefs and conceptions about technology use in teaching are key factors for understanding the slowness of technology integration. In this paper, I outline the shift of research focus from learning and technology environment-related issues to teachers' beliefs and conceptions. In addition, I highlight that over the past two decades a considerable imbalance has developed in favour of school-level research against university-level research. However, several changes in universities, such as students declining mathematical preparedness and demands from other sciences and employers, necessitate closer attention to university-level research. Thus, I outline some results of my study that aimed to reflect on the paucity of research and examined the current extend of technology use, particularly Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) at universities, mathematicians' views about the role of CAS in tertiary mathematics teaching, and the factors influencing technology integration. I argue that due to mathematicians' extensive use of CAS in their research and teaching, documenting their teaching practices and carrying out research at this level would not only be beneficial at the university level but also contribute to our understanding of technology integration at all levels.

		"abstract": "A structured interview process is proffered as an effective means to advance prospective teachers' understandings of students as learners of mathematics, a key component of pedagogical content knowledge. The interview process is carried out in three phases with the primary objective of developing listening skills for accessing students' mathematical thinking. The interviews adhere to clinical interview procedures for discovering cognitive activities and, accordingly, are initiated by presenting an open-ended mathematics task. Three rounds of interviews were completed by undergraduates enrolled in a middle school mathematics methods course. Anecdotal data generated by their interview reports suggest that the structured interview process engenders an interpretive orientation to listening to students and furthers awareness of how students make sense of mathematics. Features of the interview process that may limit its potential benefits are discussed; recommendations for further study are proposed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

The Learning Mathematics for Teaching project administered a multiple-choice assessment covering topics in number and operation to a nationally representative sample of teachers (n = 625) and at the same time collected information on teacher and student characteristics. Performance did not vary according to mathematical topic (e.g., whole numbers or rational numbers), and items categorized as requiring specialized knowledge of mathematics proved more difficult for this sample of teachers. There were few substantively significant relationships between mathematical knowledge for teaching and teacher characteristics, including leadership activities and self-reported college-level mathematics preparation.

Instructors of this course previously used examples involving mathematics content on an ad hoc basis in an attempt to illuminate desirable constructivist pedagogy but discovered that they were ineffective because students experienced difficulty with the mathematics content itself. An instrument was created to assess students' mathematics content knowledge required to understand these examples. Based on the outcome of the assessment, intentional instruction of mathematics content using anchoring examples was integrated with pedagogical instruction. Results showed significant improvement in mathematics content knowledge and confidence in that knowledge with a better understanding of constructivist pedagogy. (Contains 2 tables snd 2 notes.)",

		"abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate and characterize the geometric thinking and understanding of four pre-service middle and secondary mathematics teachers while considering their spatial ability levels. To investigate the differences, if any, that existed among these pre-service middle and secondary teachers with different spatial ability levels and understanding geometry, pre- and post-test designs were employed using Mayberry's (J. Mayberry. An investigation of the Van Hiele levels of geometric thought in undergraduate pre-service teachers, Unpublished Doctoral dissertation, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 1981) protocol. Four contrasting cases in terms of spatial ability scores are examined using the van Hiele model to provide a description of geometric understanding. The study participants were chosen using the Purdue visualization of rotations test (ROT; G.M. Bodner and R.B. Guay, The Purdue visualization of rotations test, Chem. Educ. 2 (1997), pp. 1-18) from among a pool of pre-service middle and secondary mathematics teachers at a major research university in the southeast United States. The results were supportive of previous research in this area. Learners with low spatial abilities are more challenged geometry learners. While learners identified with mid-range spatial abilities showed the most change in van Hiele levels after instruction, the low spatial ability student showed the least amount of change. The student with high spatial ability showed some change after instruction. It was identified that instructional activities that afford opportunities for fostering spatial abilities must be included in pre-service programmes so that future teachers have a mathematical foundation from which to teach geometry.",

Undergraduate dance majors were invited, through real-world problem tasks that raised central conceptual issues, to invent major ideas of calculus. This study focuses on work and thinking by these students, as they sought to build key ideas, representations and compelling lines of reasoning. Speiser and Walter''s psychological and logical perspectives (see ) provide opportunities to focus not just on the students’ thinking, but perhaps most especially, through detailed examination of important choices, on their exercise of agency as learners. Close analysis of student data through these lenses triggered the development of two new analytic categories—logic of agency and logic of proof. The analysis presented here treats students as active shapers of their own experience and understanding, whose choices open opportunities for continued growth and learning, not just for themselves but also for each other.

While this suggests that it is important for students to develop strong mathematical competencies by the end of high school, there is evidence to indicate that overall this is not the case. Both national and international studies corroborate the concern that, on the whole, US 12th grade students do not demonstrate mathematical proficiency, suggesting that students making the transition from high school to college mathematics may not be ready for its rigors. In order to investigate mathematical readiness of entering college students, this study surveyed mathematics faculty. Specifically, faculty members were asked their perceptions of average entering students' readiness related to relevant mathematical skills and concepts, and the importance of the same skills and concepts as foundations for college mathematics. Results demonstrated that the faculty perceived that average freshman students are generally not mathematically prepared; further, the skills and concepts rated as highly important--namely, algebraic skills and reasoning and generalization--were among those rated the lowest in terms of student competencies.

Several themes that have emerged from the review are discussed: diverse uses of CAS, benefits to student learning, issues of integration and mathematics learning, common and innovative usage of CAS, and integration scope in university curricula. Our analysis suggests that, perhaps contrary to popular belief, CAS integration in tertiary mathematics teaching occurs most frequently in courses for mathematics majors as opposed to service courses designed for non-math majors. The types of paper contributions indicate that the theoretical framework proposed by Lagrange, Artigue, Laborde and Trouche (2003) for literature reviews on technology use in mathematics education needs to be adapted to better address tertiary education, in particular for use in our upcoming comprehensive literature review that will build upon the pilot study review reported herein.

In this article, we further discuss a few interesting ways to apply this sequence of points in teaching college mathematics courses such as linear algebra, numerical methods in computing, and discrete mathematics. In addition to using them in individual courses, these studies may also be combined together to offer seminars or workshops to college mathematics students. Studies like these are likely to promote student interests and get students more involved in the learning process, and therefore make the learning process more effective.",

In this article, we discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of an instructional sequence that aimed to help students begin to realize the limitations of empirical arguments as methods for validating mathematical generalizations and see an intellectual need to learn about secure methods for validation (i.e., proofs). The development of the instructional sequence was part of a 4-year design experiment that we conducted in an undergraduate mathematics course, prerequisite for admission to an elementary (Grades K-6) teaching certification program. We focus on the implementation of the instructional sequence in the last of 5 research cycles of our design experiment to exemplify our theoretical framework (in which cognitive conflict played a major role) and to discuss the promise of the sequence to support the intended learning goals.

However, the concept of dimension is far from being fully understood by students, even at the college level. In this paper, we examine whether the Cartesian x-y plane is responsible for student difficulty in estimating the value of the dimension of an object, or is it only students misconceptions about dimension that lead them to a false estimation of the value of the dimension of various objects.

This study details the development, implementation and outcomes of a teaching intervention that highlights the links between mathematics and science, in the form of a first-year interdisciplinary course. A mixed method study using surveys and focus groups was employed to investigate undergraduate science students' perceptions of their experiences. Findings reveal that students bring strong beliefs about the nature of mathematics and science from secondary school, which can impact significantly on the success of interdisciplinary science-mathematics courses at the tertiary level. Despite this, a range of beneficial outcomes can arise from such courses when they are delivered within a framework of analysing real-world issues. However, students with weak mathematical skills derived little benefit from an interdisciplinary approach and are likely to disengage from learning, in comparison with students who enter university with a solid foundation in mathematics.",

Our aim was to compare responses of the same beginning teachers over the two administrations of the survey. We administered the identical survey instrument in two separate batches spreading over nearly a four-year period (1st batch fall 1999 through fall 2001; 2nd batch summer 2002). The first administration (pre-test) was conducted soon after the beginning teachers graduated from the teacher preparation program and had not started full teaching. The second administration (post-test) was conducted after the new teachers had taught full time for a minimum of a full year, with the majority having taught for two years. The instrument was crafted to measure the constructs of interest, MCTP Teacher's Beliefs and Actions of Mathematics and Science. Results for teachers who taught for at least two years indicated that in all areas the MCTP teachers \"maintained\" their reform-based beliefs and actions after their induction years. These findings provide evidence for the sustainability of positive impact in the workplace resulting from a reform-based undergraduate teacher preparation program. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

Recognizing what it is to be a solution of a linear ODE and how to postulate such solutions, without resorting to tables of solutions, is an important skill for students to carry with them to advanced courses in mathematics. In this study, we describe a teaching and learning strategy that replaces the traditional algorithmic, transmission presentation style for solving ODEs with a constructive, discovery-based approach where students employ their existing skills as a framework for constructing the solutions of first and second-order linear ODEs. We elaborate on how the strategy was implemented and discuss the resulting impact on a first-year undergraduate class. Finally, we propose further improvements to the strategy as well as suggesting other topics which could be taught in a similar manner.",

We found significant differences in how the respondents from the two disciplines assessed the relationship between research and teaching.

On the basis of a review of the distinction between conceptual and procedural knowledge, an analysis of student solutions to tasks designed to be solved with a conceptual approach but 'proceduralized' by the students sheds some new light on this classical distinction. It is argued that the distinction can be operationalized in test items in a meaningful way but that caution needs to be taken in interpreting the results considering the complex interdependence of these constructs when doing mathematical work.",

Subjects were selected from five higher education institutions in the state where faculty had a two- to five-year association with a reform-based NSF professional development program. Observer field notes and a researcher-designed observation instrument were used to describe and compare teaching practices. The participants in this study taught science and mathematics content courses for majors, non-majors, as well as education majors. Our observation method created a descriptive profile that enabled comparisons across a variety of teaching contexts. The main results showed that the faculty lacked practices that supported development of divergent thinking, conceptual thinking, and metacognitive thinking skills. Observed differences in the profiles of instruction included greater emphasis on real-world connections in science and greater use of cooperative problem solving in mathematics. A case study of a large lecture course describes reformed teaching practices in even the most challenging setting.",

The intent of this description is to highlight some important insights provided by an analysis of the students’ mathematical activity. First, the analysis resulted in the identification of a number of informal student strategies that anticipated the formal concepts. Second, the analysis provided insight into how these strategies could be evoked. Third, the analysis provided insight into how these strategies could be leveraged to support the development of the formal concepts. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]",

		"abstract": "The transition from school to tertiary study of mathematics comes under increasing scrutiny in research. This article reports on some findings from a project analysing the transition from secondary to tertiary education in mathematics. One key variable in this transition is the teacher or lecturer. This article deals with a small part of the data from the project-analysing secondary teachers' and lecturers' responses to questions on the differences they perceive between school and university and the importance of calculus, a bridging content. The results provide evidence of similarities and differences in the thinking of teachers and lecturers about the transition process. They also show that each group lacks a clear understanding of the issues involved in the transition from the other's perspective, and there is a great need for improved communication between the two sectors.",

		"abstract": "The conceptual knowledge of science processes possessed by University of Botswana science students and senior secondary school science teachers was sought through a three-part questionnaire. One part requested demographic data of subjects, the second part asked them to select their level of familiarity with the processes, and the third part probed their conceptual definitions of the science processes. The definitions were scored as incorrect, partially correct and correct on an ordinal scale. Statistical analysis was done using Spearman rho correlation and one sample t test. The findings revealed that the science teachers did not have sufficient conceptual knowledge of science processes to help their students to understand in a meaningful way; both students' and teachers' views of their familiarity of science processes did not corroborate their demonstrated ability to provide acceptable conceptual definitions of the processes; there was no association between students' and teachers' conceptions of the science processes; and if conceptual knowledge of science processes was demanded, the entering students, who were the immediate graduates of the senior secondary schools, might not have enough to pursue tertiary level science courses. It is suggested that both conceptual and operational knowledge of science processes be required at secondary and tertiary levels of science education. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2008.",

		"abstract": "This article derives from a case study of 10 secondary school teaching assistants (TAs) who did not have conventional pre-qualifications in mathematics but who undertook an honours degree in mathematics education studies at a Higher Education Institution in England whilst continuing to work as TAs in school. Work-based learning was thus undertaken in parallel with advancement through the hierarchical undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Lave and Wenger’s work on communities of practice is used as a framework to explore the TAs’ learning of mathematics alongside their professional work in schools. This case illustrates how and where institution-based undergraduate teaching relates to work in school, and where it does not, thus signalling the importance of the TAs’ informal learning strategies in bringing together these experiences.

		"abstract": "This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N=52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms.",

		"abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate biomathtutor by (i) investigating the impact of biomathtutor on the mathematics skills competencies of bioscience undergraduates, and (ii) assessing students' and tutors' reactions to biomathtutor, identifying whether and how tutors might integrate it into their curricula and blend it with more traditional teaching practices to enhance their students' learning experiences. A multi-method approach was adopted in which a quasi-experiment and non-experimental evaluation of biomathtutor were used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data, using mathematics tests, questionnaires, tutor interviews and student focus groups. Eighty-nine bioscience undergraduates and eight tutors participated in the study. A comparison of student performance in the quasi-experiment, which adopted a pre-test-intervention-post-test methodology, revealed no significant difference between pre-test and post-test scores for either the 'control' group (no intervention) or for any of the mathematics learning support interventions used, including biomathtutor. Despite the limitations of the quasi-experiment which are discussed, tutors' and their students' reactions towards biomathtutor were very positive, with both groups agreeing that biomathtutor represents a very well designed and useful learning resource that has a valuable role to play in supporting mathematics learning within bioscience curricula. Students felt that using biomathtutor had helped them acquire new biological and mathematical knowledge and had increased their competence and confidence in mathematics, with many students confirming that they would use biomathtutor again. Tutors felt it would be useful to embed biomathtutor, where possible, into their curricula, perhaps linking it to assessment strategies or integrating it with their current more traditional teaching practices. Students indicated that they too would like to see biomathtutor embedded within their curricula, primarily because it would motivate them to use the resource. Modifications to biomathtutor, which may need to be considered in light of any potential further development of this resource, are discussed. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This study extends the debate concerning the mathematical skills deficit of bioscience undergraduates towards a deeper understanding of their mathematics learning, since only through the latter can appropriate and effective explicit teaching be implemented. Three hundred and twenty-six first-year bioscience undergraduates, from three pre- and four post-1992 UK universities completed a basic mathematics test, comprising 10 pure abstract mathematical calculations and 10 brief word problems set within biological contexts. In addition to participants' overall performance in the test, the students' performances on individual test items were analysed and students' test scripts examined for the methods of calculation adopted as well as the types of errors and misconceptions students exhibited. The test proved challenging for many participants, with 60% of students achieving scores of ≤40% and only 6% of students scoring 70-90%; the mean score was 38.5%. Although students' scores on the abstract items correlated positively with their scores on the word problems, scores were significantly higher on the pure abstract mathematics questions (mean score 55%) than on the contextualized word problems (mean score 23%). A high proportion (52-95%) of students encountered difficulties with individual questions involving the calculation of volume or surface area, the conversion of units of measurement, working with ratios, proportions and powers of 10, and determining magnification or magnitude. Students also exhibited a greater reluctance to attempt the contextualized word problems (11-75% did not attempt individual items) than the pure abstract mathematics calculations (2-12% did not attempt individual questions). Many of the errors and misconceptions students exhibited were similar to those reported previously as made commonly by 13-14-year-old children. Factors potentially influencing the students' performance and the educational implications of the findings are discussed, with particular reference to contextualized mathematics learning and learning transfer in bioscience.",

The three samples included in this study involved 257 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in the courses during the academic year in which the study occurred. The results indicate that: (a) students acquired a better understanding of targeted chemistry concepts during the multimedia courses, (b) some categories of students, based on their major area of study, computer use, and attendance status at orientation achieved significantly (p∈<∈0.05) higher post-test scores when adjusted for pre-test performance, and (c) significant differences and Cohen's effect sizes in attitudes toward chemistry and learning chemistry were detected for students' level of computer use, disposition toward computer multimedia, gender, and attendance at the multimedia orientation session.

Students in four sections received traditional instruction on the formal definition of limit, but in two other sections an approach utilising graphing calculators was incorporated into the instruction for one and two days, respectively.

Participants were selected from one community college, one state university and one private college. Students were volunteers from three Calculus I classrooms (one class from each school) in which Matlab was used extensively. A survey regarding students' attitude and experience on using the Matlab program was administered to classes. The findings of the study indicated that gender differences are not related to students' attitude and experience on the program. The results revealed slightly positive correlation between students' attitude toward and experience of the program. The implications of this study shows that teachers who use Matlab in their instruction and classroom practices should pay attention on how students use it, the obstacles students had to overcome to succeed in its use, and their general issues and concerns regarding Matlab use.

Our data are drawn from students’ engagement with two well-known paradoxes - Hilbert’s Grand Hotel and the Ping-Pong Ball Conundrum - before, during, and after instruction. While graduate students found the resolution of Hilbert’s Grand Hotel paradox unproblematic, responses of students in both groups to the Ping-Pong Ball Conundrum were surprisingly similar. Consistent with prior research, the work of participants in our study revealed that they perceive infinity as an ongoing process, rather than a completed one, and fail to notice conflicting ideas. Our contribution is in describing specific challenging features of these paradoxes that might influence students’ understanding of infinity, as well as the persuasive factors in students’ reasoning, that have not been unveiled by other means. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

		"abstract": "Graphing calculators and data collection technology was integrated in an undergraduate science methods classes for preservice elementary school teachers. The study investigated whether preservice teachers' knowledge and comfort with the use of graphing calculator technology and their perspectives in the use of graphing calculator technology were influenced by integration of this technology in the methods course over a period of one semester. Towards this end a survey was administered to all class participants at the beginning and at the end of the semester. The survey addressed preservice teachers' confidence level with the calculator-based technology, attitudes towards using this technology for their own learning, and the attitudes towards using it as a teaching tool. In addition, preservice teachers completed several open-ended reflections throughout the semester that provided qualitative data. The results of this study suggest that the preservice teachers view the graphing calculator as a productivity tool while they view data collection devices as a teaching tool. More exposure to technology produces more influence on preservice teachers' perspectives and attitudes, but not necessarily their confidence. Confidence and perspective are somewhat independent of each other. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

		"abstract": "There has been a broad wave of change in tertiary calculus courses in the past decade. However, the much-needed change in tertiary pre-calculus programmes— aimed at bridging the gap between high-school mathematics and tertiary mathematics—is happening at a far slower pace. Following a discussion on the nature of the gap and the objectives of a potential bridging programme, this paper aims at demonstrating that the gap can be bridged, by presenting an ongoing modular bridging programme especially designed for the diverse types of student populations in teachers training colleges. We also present here some innovative teaching and assessment methods that were judged essential for the success of these programmes—focusing mainly on the \"Questionnaire Based Instruction Method\". Finally we suggest directions of follow up and research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "In his 1976 book, Proofs and Refutations, Lakatos presents a collection of case studies to illustrate methods of mathematical discovery in the history of mathematics. In this paper, we reframe these methods in ways that we have found make them more amenable for use as a framework for research on learning and teaching mathematics. We present an episode from an undergraduate abstract algebra classroom to illustrate the guided reinvention of mathematics through processes that strongly parallel those described by Lakatos. Our analysis suggests that the constructs described by Lakatos can provide a useful framework for making sense of the mathematical activity in classrooms where students are actively engaged in the development of mathematical ideas and provide design heuristics for instructional approaches that support the learning of mathematics through the process of guided reinvention.

		"abstract": "We ground Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) in studies of workplace practices from a mathematical point of view. We draw on multiple case study visits by college students and teacher-researchers to workplaces. By asking questions that 'open boxes', we 'outsiders and boundary-crossers' sought to expose contradictions between College and work, induce breakdowns and identify salient mathematics. Typically, we find that mathematical processes have been historically crystallised in 'black boxes' shaped by workplace cultures: its instruments, rules and divisions of labour tending to disguise or hide mathematics. These black boxes are of two kinds, signalling two key processes by which mathematics is put to work. The first involves automation, when the work of mathematics is crystallised in instruments, tools and routines: this process tends to distribute and hide mathematical work, but also evolves a distinct workplace 'genre' of mathematical practice. The second process involves sub-units of the community being protected from mathematics by a division of labour supported by communal rules, norms and expectations. These are often regulated by boundary objects that are the object of activity on one side of the boundary but serve as instruments of activity on the other side. We explain contradictions between workplace and College practices in analyses of the contrasting functions of the activity systems that structure them and that consequently provide for different genres and distributions of mathematics, and finally draw inferences for better alignment of College programmes with the needs of students. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",

This is especially true at post secondary institutions where many instructors are using slideware as a sole instructional tool. This study evaluated the relative effectiveness of scientific visualization in two PowerPoint delivery strategies on science learning for preservice teachers. Twenty-five preservice teachers enrolled in an undergraduate introduction to science education class were stratified into two PowerPoint delivery strategies. The strategies were: PowerPoint with instructor voiceover narration and PowerPoint without voiceover. Post-test Mann-Whitney U suggested no differences (p > 0.05) in science learning across the two strategies. Further, eye tracking analysis suggests voiceover guides the PowerPoint user to graphics and text, but voiceover does not significantly affect learning. Results suggest immediacy with technology doesn't necessarily produce meaningful learning. Good teaching still is the key component of meaningful learning. © 2006 National Science Council.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: In this research report we examine knowledge other than content knowledge needed by a mathematician in his first use of an inquiry-oriented curriculum for teaching an undergraduate course in differential equations. Collaboratively, the mathematician and two mathematics education researchers identified the challenges faced by the mathematician as he began to adopt reform-minded teaching practices. Our analysis reveals that responding to those challenges entailed formulating and addressing particular instructional goals, previously unfamiliar to the instructor. From a cognitive analytical perspective, we argue that the instructor''s knowledge — or lack of knowledge — influenced his ability to set and accomplish his instructional goals as he planned for, reflected on, and enacted instruction. By studying the teaching practices of a professional mathematician, we identify forms of knowledge apart from mathematical content knowledge that are essential to reform-oriented teaching, and we highlight how knowledge acquired through more traditional instructional practices may fail to support research-based forms of student-centered teaching.

		"abstract": "This present study investigated engineering students' conceptions and misconceptions related to derivative, particularly interpreting the graph of a function and constructing its derivative graph. Participants were 147 first year engineering students from four universities enrolled in first year undergraduate calculus courses with or without the incorporation of computers for the purposes of seeing the power of visualization, investigating worked examples given in steps and solving various questions related to the worked examples, assisting conceptual understanding, and/or providing feedback besides lectures in the classroom. Students were tested before and after being exposed to instruction on differentiation and integration by a diagnostic test measuring their understanding of major aspects of calculus. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 18 students. Analyses of the results revealed that A-level student's performance was improving more than non-A-level students, particularly in computer groups. The analyses of the students' written and oral responses in all groups indicated that prototypes, poor understanding of the notion of limit, confusion between the process and the product, and difficulties in using graphical information to give meaning to symbolic representation account for the errors and the misconceptions identified.",

In this paper, this study is generalized further to develop a few interesting case study proposals that can be used for student projects in college mathematics courses such as real functions, analytic geometry, and complex variables. In addition to using them in individual courses, these studies may also be combined to offer seminars or workshops to college mathematics students. Projects like these are likely to promote student interest and get students more involved in the learning process, and therefore make the learning process more effective.",

This effort was partially a result of a five year statewide National Science Foundation (NSF) grant entitled the Rocky Mountain Teacher Enhancement Collaborative. The major thrust of this grant was to implement reform in core mathematics courses that would effect a shift to a learning paradigm from the traditional instructional paradigm. The central teaching action involved in this reform of abstract algebra was the use of team teaching in a cooperative group setting. The liaison of a mathematician working collaboratively with a mathematics educator provided valuable lessons in understanding key components of effective teaching. A series of qualitative interviews were conducted along with several supporting surveys. The survey data along with various forms of student evaluations served as a basis for drawing conclusions for the study.",

The way in which he handles visual-graphic representations in a problem of uniformly accelerating motion in order to reach mathematical conclusions and justify them with strict formal reasoning, making the transition from the intuitive assumptions to the mathematical argumentation, is studied. The 'focal analysis' of the interview's content allows for an in depth investigation of qualitative elements of the student's mathematical thought. The study of the cognitive operations through the interconnection of various theoretical perspectives may lead to teaching interventions in order to develop students' intuitive forces in a controlled manner, so that the formal mathematical thinking process can be promoted.

		"abstract": "A major challenge to improving science education lies in the shortage of qualified science teachers. A potential solution to this challenge consists of directing the energy and talent of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to reinvigorate science education in schools. This requires creating new, more accessible pathways for science professionals to enter teaching careers. In this article, the authors present the outcomes of a program they established to provide a flexible alternative certification program for grades 8-12 to address teacher supply in science and mathematics. This program was developed from a partnership between a College of Education and Human Development and a College of Medicine that has provided a talent pool of candidates with strong academic backgrounds in science and mathematics. They realized the sizable number of applicants across all levels of academic preparation were not admitted into their online certification programs due to several factors.",

While the students in the lecture-based course demonstrated conceptions of proof that reflect those reported in the research literature as insufficient and typical of undergraduates, the students in the problem-based course were found to hold conceptions of and approach the construction of proofs in ways that demonstrated efforts to make sense of mathematical ideas. This sense-making manifested itself in the ways in which students employed initial strategies, notation, prior knowledge and experiences, and concrete examples in the proof construction process. These differences were also seen when students were asked to determine the validity of completed proofs. These results suggest that such a problem-based course may provide opportunities for students to develop conceptions of proof that are more meaningful and robust than does a traditional lecture-based course. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

		"abstract": "Reformers seeking to increase student understanding and interest are looking to collaborative partnerships to support improved science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching. At the college level partnerships across colleges are encouraged by reformers in order to provide all students with strong content understanding, model recommended practices for future teachers, and increase participation by underrepresented groups in STEM careers. Collaborative curriculum development, however, is not a trivial undertaking and success is not guaranteed. A better understanding of how partners with different backgrounds interact and what types of instructional changes can be expected from initial attempts will facilitate this potentially powerful approach to instructional change. In this project, 2 engineers and 2 science educators worked jointly to develop a design-based core engineering course to meet the needs and interests of future engineers and science educators. Interaction among planners and development progress were documented by written meeting records and reflections, emails, and records of planning stages and products. Analysis characterized interactions between engineers and educators and the resulting instructional changes. In spite of a strong interest in partners' topics and mutual goals, specialized language and professional cultural differences presented obstacles to understanding and development progress. Also described are the types of instructional changes reasonable to expect in initial development efforts. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Part of this challenge involves using students' thinking and understanding as a basis for the development of mathematical ideas (cf. NCTM, 2000). The purpose of this article is to address this challenge by developing the notion of pedagogical content tool. A pedagogical content tool is a device such as a graph, diagram, equation, or verbal statement that a teacher intentionally uses to connect to student thinking while moving the mathematical agenda forward. We tender two examples of pedagogical content tools: Transformational record and generative alternative. These two pedagogical content tools are put forth as instructional counterparts to the Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) design heuristics of emergent models and guided reinvention, respectively. We illustrate the pedagogical content tools of transformational record and generative alternative by drawing on examples from two classroom teaching experiments in undergraduate differential equations.

		"abstract": "This study examined Korean secondary science teachers’ perceptions of the introduction of socio‐scientific issues (SSI) into the science curriculum. The guiding research questions were (a) What are teachers’ perceptions of SSI and the place of these issues in the science curriculum? and (b) What are some factors that impede or facilitate addressing SSI in Korean secondary classrooms? The factors that were explored included teachers’ perceptions of the necessity of addressing SSI, teachers’ personal science‐teaching efficacy (PSTE) beliefs regarding SSI, and other relevant situational factors. The 86 participants (65% female) completed a questionnaire comprising Likert‐type and open‐ended questions. Next, follow‐up, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with a random sample of 12 participants. Results indicated that participants perceived a need to address SSI positively. However, only a minority dealt with such issues in their classrooms and then only sporadically. Participants had low PSTE beliefs related to teaching about SSI. They perceived the lack of instructional time and the unavailability of relevant materials as the primary obstacles that hindered the teaching of SSI. It is argued that the culture of pre‐college science education in Korea, which is still largely dominated by a preoccupation with preparing students for admission to institutions of higher education, subsumes those obstacles identified and experienced by the participant teachers. © 2006 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Nothing is as difficult to see as the obvious (B. Malinowski) Through the importance of the number three in our culture and the strange preference for a ternary pattern of our nature one can perceive how and why number theory degraded to numerology. The strong preference of our minds for simple patterns can be read as the key to understanding not only the development of numerology, but also why scientists were and are prone to give their discoveries or creations a structure that is based on simple patterns and, among them, especially the ternary pattern. If some numbers seem to appear quite often throughout the fabric of reality, like zero, one, two, and three, reality has, nevertheless, been preferentially analysed in a way to enhance its ternary character. The present excursion through some scientific domains where the ternary pattern has been used tries to offer an answer to the fascination that some numbers, and patterns based on them, exerted and exerts, even today, on human minds. Throughout the overall models created by the human mind, be they natural or spiritual, the models based on a 'unary' and on a 'dualistic' pattern are surely important, but the model based on a ternary pattern ended up assuming an archetypical character, which is quite intriguing, and deserves to be deepened. The paper is a useful resource for projects for students and background material for teachers of mathematics touching, as it does, on biology, chemistry and physics. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",

Those findings could provide their instructors with the valuable information required in order to adapt their teaching methods to the students' needs. The test included open-ended questions and was administered on the first day of the course. The data obtained were analysed in relation to the students' gender, age and having attended or not attended advanced courses in biology at the high-school level. Students could have prior knowledge on a topic to be learned, which, if identified and accounted for in the teaching, could serve as a receptor for a constructivist mode of study. The results indicated that undergraduate students hold misconceptions which could obstruct the acquisition of new knowledge. They encounter learning difficulties, which, if are known to the instructors and addressed in their teaching, could facilitate students' learning. The possible use of a formative pre-assessment procedure, which could guide the instruction and learning process from the beginning of a course, is discussed. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2006.",

		"abstract": "In this article students' understanding of trigonometric functions in the context of two college trigonometry courses is investigated. The first course was taught by a professor unaffiliated with the study in a lecture-based course, while the second was taught using an experimental instruction paradigm based on Gray and Tall's (1994) notion of procept and current process-object theories of learning. Via interviews and a paper-and-pencil test, I examined students' understanding of trigonometric functions for both classes. The results indicate that the students who were taught in the lecture-based course developed a very limited understanding of these functions. Students who received the experimental instruction developed a deep understanding of trigonometric functions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This paper is part of a range of studies that seek to improve classroom interactions to promote good teaching and learning in science education, in this case undergraduate chemistry. Here we focus upon learning through questioning and deal with some of the mechanisms of students’ question asking. All summaries of research in this field show that teaching through encouraging students to ask questions results in gains in comprehension and understanding, which can be tested in a variety of ways. Over time we have amassed evidence that questions aid the structuring of learning through clarification of intent, fact finding, improving grasp of principles, and clarifying the explicit and tacit organization of learning to be done. We have tackled four forms of interaction between question asking and attendant emotions: within internal processes, on the social production of questions, on the subject matter of questions, and on the outcomes of question asking. We use examples from a range of our own studies to illustrate these interactions, culminating in four student case studies where students had the opportunity to set out reflective questions concerning their learning and their involvement with their chemistry courses. Within these studies, we have also provided illustrations of the ‘iterative duality’ of questions, as both stimuli for and outcomes of variation and change in students’ thinking. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Experimental physics is seen as an essential part of tertiary physics education. Students are supposed to develop practical skills and advance from closed 'cookbook' experiments to open experiment and design experiment procedures independently. As a consequence tertiary practical physics courses increase in the level of challenge throughout an undergraduate degree program. The research reported here consists of an investigation of two solely laboratory-based experimental physics courses: a second-year course Experimental Physics and Instrumentation, and a third-year course Advanced Experimental Physics, offered at a New Zealand tertiary institution. The research suggests that although the structure, content, and teaching methods in the two courses vary; there is little difference in students' learning strategies employed in the two courses. It appears bridging experiments may be necessary to help students shift from a highly directive pedagogy at the lower levels of the undergraduate practical physics program, to a more open inquiry approach. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2005.",

		"abstract": "Flowing granular mixtures in rotating cylindrical drums arise in numerous industrial settings and are of great technological significance worldwide. To date, the development of a robust mathematical model for this process remains an open research problem. However, simple mathematical models may be developed that capture some of the underlying mechanisms, including segregation. The key lies in the analysis of the flowing surface layer whose profile is characteristically S-shaped: past models have shown that capturing this characteristic is an essential ingredient in predicting segregation. Using secondary to first-year undergraduate level mathematics, an analysis is presented of the flowing surface layer, which leads to an S-shaped profile. This problem presents an ideal case study for teaching applied mathematics and modelling. Interesting simulations that aid the visualization of this problem can be downloaded from the web, and simple classroom demonstrations of this process can be assembled with no specialized equipment.",

		"abstract": "This study was conducted in a reform-based mathematics and science teacher education program in the USA, the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation(MCTP). The goal of the undergraduate program was to prepare upper elementary/middle level specialists in mathematics and science. One significant aspect of the MCTP was the expectation that the program's professors (in mathematics and science) would model a new vision of effective pedagogy based on reform-based recommendations. We determined, in general, that the program's mathematics and science content professors accepted the dual role of modeling effective instruction at the same time they were delivering content. However, this dual responsibility raised in their minds an 'issue of appropriate balance' between content and pedagogical foci in their courses. Previously, the professors' had not questioned a focus heavily tilted toward content coverage. We also determined that the program's teacher candidates believed that the mathematics and science professors modeled effective instruction. One of the primary reasons that the teacher candidates believed that their professors were modeling effective instruction was that the focus in the courses was primarily on conceptual understanding, not memorization. A major implication was that the professors' modeling of reform-based instruction prompted the teacher candidates to develop a new vision of mathematics and science teaching shaped by their professors' example. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2005.",

		"abstract": "The work reported here focuses upon the progress of a university department as it attempts to orchestrate the interplay between the demands of undergraduate chemistry and the particular learning characteristics of students, and the approaches to teaching and learning favoured by staff. The discipline of chemistry is depicted as a practical scientific discipline that is continuously undergoing change and advancement and not as a static, abstract body of transmitted knowledge. The learners in the course come from a range of backgrounds, and have been surveyed for their learning preferences using Kolb’s (1999) Learning Styles Inventory. This has allowed the department to ‘tune’ or tailor some of its course provision towards these characteristics. These developments include ‘enhancement’ lectures to broaden the appeal of chemistry, moves to enact a greater devolution of learning to the learners, and the re‐configuring of traditional laboratory exercises and project work to increase learner autonomy. The orchestration of learning in this way does not come without some instances of resistance to change but, in the main, as evidenced in some of the feedback from students, is an important move in the professional re‐shaping of university provision of the science. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "• Two ways undergraduate students think about graphs are reported. • Some students focused on values represented by coordinates of points on graphs. • Some students focused on locations of points in coordinate space on graphs. • Students' interpretations of graphs impact their evaluation of Calculus statements. The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of students' thinking about aspects of graphs in the context of evaluating statements about real-valued functions from Calculus. We conducted clinical interviews in which undergraduate students evaluated mathematical statements using graphs to explain their reasoning. From our data analysis, we found two ways students think about graphs, value-thinking and location-thinking. These two ways of thinking were rooted in students' attention to different attributes of points on graphs we provided: either the values represented by the points or the locations of the points in space. In this paper, we report our classification of students' thinking about aspects of graphs in terms of value-thinking and location-thinking. Our findings indicate that students' thinking about aspects of graphs accounts for key differences in their understandings of mathematical statements. We discuss some implications of our findings for instruction and curriculum development in Calculus and beyond. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

However, such credentials do not guarantee deep mathematics knowledge nor effective teaching, particularly in low-income schools serving a majority of Black and Latinx students. We present a portrait of two NYC Teaching Fellows secondary mathematics teachers, their mathematics preparation and credentials, and how their supervisors viewed them. We further present findings from two years of classroom observations and show that these SARP mathematics teachers resorted to the direct, procedural teaching style they had known themselves, held superficial mathematical understandings, regularly made math errors, and often struggled to coherently answer students’ mathematical questions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

		"abstract": "We investigated beginning secondary science teachers' understandings of the science and engineering practice of developing and using models. Our study was situated in a scholarship program that served two groups: undergraduate STEM majors interested in teaching, or potential teachers, and graduate students enrolled in a teacher education program to earn their credentials, or preservice teachers. The two groups completed intensive practicum experiences in STEM-focused academies within two public high schools. We conducted a series of interviews with each participant and used grade-level competencies outlined in the \"Next Generation Science Standards\" to analyze their understanding of the practice of developing and using models. We found that potential and preservice teachers understood this practice in ways that both aligned and did not align with the NGSS and that their understandings varied across the two groups and the two practicum contexts. In our implications, we recommend that teacher educators recognize and build from the various ways potential and preservice teachers understand this complex practice to improve its implementation in science classrooms. Further, we recommend that a variety of practicum contexts may help beginning teachers develop a greater breadth of understanding about the practice of developing and using models.",

		"abstract": "In our study, 32 German and Swiss 8th/9th-grade classes of lower-secondary school worked with their teacher on the same proving problem. The sample belongs to the Swiss-German study “Quality of Instruction, Learning Behavior and Mathematical Understanding”. Our data analyses relate to the teachers’ approaches to generating a specific form of evidence with their classes when dealing with a particular elementary number-theory problem. We address the question of how the different strategies can be characterized as manifestations of a certain approach to proving and try to clarify in which way the observed approach can be interpreted as adaptive teaching behavior. For this purpose, we searched for possible correlations between three main strategies or types of generating a specific form of evidence (experimental, operative, formal-deductive approach) on the one hand and (a) the teachers’ beliefs and personal characteristics and (b) the students’ prior knowledge of algebra and mathematics in general on the other hand. As our analyses show, three main approaches to proving occurred but not in equal proportions: there is a predominance of the approach that entails the highest extent of formalization and abstraction. Nevertheless, an operative way of proving is widespread too. On the whole, the findings indicate that one particular approach to proving can be interpreted as a personal preference of a specific group of teachers and, at the same time, with respect to the students’ mathematical skills as a manifestation of adaptive teaching behavior. © 2019, FIZ Karlsruhe.",

This study investigates 12 undergraduate students’ sense-making activities while watching videos about topics in introductory statistics. Analysis of interview data indicated that the students made sense of the videos in very different ways and that the challenges students faced varied widely from person to person. These results highlight the need to take into account the wide variety in students’ background knowledge and sense-making practices when creating videos. These results also suggest the importance of structuring students’ interactions with videos so that video lectures may become more useful instructional tools for a larger number of students. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "In the United States and elsewhere, prospective teachers of secondary mathematics are usually required to complete numerous advanced mathematics courses before obtaining certification. However, several research studies suggest that teachers’ experiences in these advanced mathematics courses have little influence on their pedagogical practice and efficacy. To understand this phenomenon, we presented 14 secondary mathematics teachers with four statements and proofs in real analysis that related to secondary content and asked the participants to discuss whether these proofs could inform their teaching of secondary mathematics. In analyzing participants’ remarks, we propose that many teachers view the utility of real analysis in secondary school mathematics teaching using a transport model, where the perceived importance of a real analysis explanation is dependent upon the teacher's ability to transport that explanation directly into their instruction in a secondary mathematics classroom. Consequently, their perceived value of a real analysis course in their teacher preparation is inherently limited. We discuss implications of the transport model on secondary mathematics teacher education. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "Given two vectors u and v, their cross product u × v is a vector perpendicular to u and v. The motivation for this property, however, is never addressed. Here we show that the existence of the cross and dot products and the perpendicularity property follow from the concept of linear combination, which does not involve products of vectors. For our proof we consider the plane generated by a linear combination of uand v. When looking for the coefficients in the linear combination required to reach a desired point on the plane, the solution involves the existence of a normal vector n = u × v. Our results have a bearing on the history of vector analysis, as a product similar to the cross product but without the perpendicularity requirement existed at the same time. These competing products originate in the work of two major nineteen-century mathematicians, W. Hamilton, and H. Grassmann. These historical aspects are discussed in some detail here. We also address certain aspects of the teaching of u × v to undergraduate students, which is known to carry some difficulties. This includes the algebraic and geometric denitions of u × v, the rule for the direction of u × v, and the pseudovectorial nature of u × v. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "The aim is to contribute to the research on the conception and development of mathematics textbooks for undergraduate distance education courses (EAD). In particular, we acknowledge the EAD undergraduate courses in Brazil as an important governmental initiative for teacher education. Amongst other specificities of the Brazilian model of distance education, one aspect consists of writing proper material and textbooks, raising a need to investigate the results of their conception and development. We report on a case study in which a chapter in a written textbook developed by a group of professors is analysed according to hermeneutics, describing the tessiture of the text and context of the implemented task. Aware that the task demanded processes different from those used when writing textbooks for face-to-face lecture courses, though at the same time not coinciding with the wordings of the interactions of a classroom lecture, the group of authors agreed on a notion of lessons on paper. Our analysis faces the challenge of problematising qualitative differences regarding the semiotic means of the mathematics embedded in face-to-face versus distance learning activities, raising questions on the nature of their results and the development of induced thinking in both contexts. Investigating the kind of mathematical knowledge produced for the lessons on paper texts, we drew on whether the written lesson for distance education is closer to the pedagogical-content knowledge than to the classical academic knowledge.

Yet, little is known about how such expectations shape instruction in proof-oriented courses. This paper investigates this issue in a case study of an experimental teaching strategy, designed by a mathematics professor, for scaffolding student independent proof reading. On the basis of interviews and classroom observations we scrutinize the instructor’s course image – his envisioning of the teaching and learning activities, inside and outside class, throughout the course. We examine a representative case of proof presentation through the lens of the instructor’s course image. Our analysis reveals complex relationships between various teaching and learning activities in the course, and demonstrates that unpacking these relationships can provide valuable insights into specific teaching practices. Findings suggest that the concept of course image can be useful in enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying collegiate mathematics instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Further, these dominant examples were found to bias the conceptual knowledge acquired by students who showed a tendency to conceive of nonhuman conduct in terms of mammalian and avian action.

Analysis of definition structure including necessary, sufficient, and minimal conditions, as well as hierarchical and partitional structure, provides insight into what NPSTs may think about the form of mathematical definitions in general. Analysis of the properties used in definitions of each shape type and the frequency of those properties reveals the shape types with which NPSTs are most and least familiar.

Through observations of lectures and discussions with first-year mathematics undergraduates in an English university, we identified and analysed the messages that two of their lecturers transmitted to them during this transitional phase. The results suggest that strongly framed messages are more easily perceived by students and affect them during their transition.

Consistent with the American college classroom, a simple causal chain was anticipated in which instructor immediacy behaviors positively induced a psychological response to immediacy, which had a negative influence on math anxiety. Study 1 tested this model in the Chinese college classroom and the model failed. It was speculated that perhaps given the high testing admission standards of Chinese colleges (i.e., the GaoKao), that Chinese college students were a biased sample of only students who had learned to manage their anxieties.

The study involved a site visit to the University of Alberta campus (June 2015) during which: interviews were conducted with five mathematics faculty members and seven mathematics students; math lectures were attended; and artifacts were collected such as course outlines, software demonstrations, and assessment tools. Interviews were transcribed and the data entered into Atlas.ti qualitative research software for the purpose of thematic analysis. Findings center around the innovative use of the open source, CAS-based software both in the teaching (answer checking, interactive lecture demonstrations) and assessment (studentgenerated optimization problems, mid-terms, final exams) practices of one particular instructor who taught seven iterations of a Mathematical Programming and Optimization undergraduate course.

A didactical experience consisting on a modeling situation and a didactical sequence to guide students' work on the situation were designed and tested using APOS theory. We show results of research on students' activity and learning while using the sequence and through analysis of student's work and assessment questions. The didactic sequence proved to have potential to foster students' learning of function, matrix transformations and matrix multiplication. A detailed analysis of those constructions that seem to be essential for students understanding of this topic including linear transformations is presented.

		"abstract": "To enable high school students, especially those interested in art and design-related careers, to improve their ability to integrate knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in their creative design practices and to be familiar with auto manufacturing, the development of a bridging curriculum, known as STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) using digital tools such as 3D printers, has been increasingly recognized as emergent and vital. As a bridging curriculum, it is essential to examine the curriculum with respect to high school and college students to highlight the differences in their knowledge and skills for improving curriculum development. Hence, we conducted a teaching experiment using a CO2-car engineering design curriculum in this study to analyze the learning outcomes of four groups of students (three 3D-printing groups: 108 high school students, 12 design college students, and 12 engineering college students; one handmade group: 36 high school students) to assess their competencies. The results of the present study highlight significant differences in creativity, forecast accuracy, race outcomes, and learning outcomes. Suggestions based on the results were generated to improve the curriculum. The findings in this study serve as a reference for the future design, development, and implementation of STEAM curricula. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "This article describes a sequence of design research projects, some exploratory others more formal, on the teaching of modelling and the analysis of modelling skills. The initial motivation was the author's observation that the teaching of applied mathematics in UK high schools and universities involved no active modelling by students, but was entirely focused on their learning standards models of a restricted range of phenomena, largely from Newtonian mechanics. This did not develop the numeracy/mathematical literacy that was so clearly important for future citizens. Early explorations started with modelling workshops with high school teachers and mathematics undergraduates, observed and analysed--in some case using video. The theoretical basis of this work has been essentially heuristic, though the Shell Centre studies included, for example, a detailed analysis of formulation processes that has not, as so often, been directly replicated. Recent work has focused on developing a formative assessment approach to teaching modelling that has proved both successful and popular. Finally, the system-level challenges in trying to establish modelling as an integral part of mathematics curricula are briefly discussed.",

Two instructors collaborated to determine daily lecture notes, assigned the same homework problems, and gave identical exams; however, compared to a more traditional instructional approach, the flipped instructor utilized videos to communicate more procedural course content to students out-of-class, with time in-class spent on more conceptual activities and homework problems. Findings from two semesters indicate similar performance on more procedural problems and small to moderate gains for the flipped students (N = 74) over their traditional counterparts (N = 77) on more conceptual exam problems. However, student perceptions remain mixed, with flipped students reporting increased communication during class but traditional students perceiving more effective use of class time, despite the gains in performance for flipped students. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

This is achieved through the use of video analysis and a theoretical framework comprising Rowland's Knowledge Quartet and general pedagogical knowledge. The study reports on the findings in relation to these tutors’ provision of mathematics support to first and second year undergraduate engineering students and second year undergraduate science students. It was found that tutors are lacking in various pedagogical skills which are needed for high-quality learning amongst service mathematics students (e.g. engineering/science/technology students), a demographic which have low levels of mathematics upon entering university. Tutors teach their support classes in a very fast didactic way with minimal opportunities for students to ask questions or to attempt problems. It was also found that this teaching method is even more so exaggerated in mandatory departmental mathematics tutorials that students take as part of their mathematics studies at tertiary level. The implications of the findings on mathematics tutor training at tertiary level are also discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The purpose of this note is to present an alternative approach using ‘exact methods’, illustrating that a substitution and linearization of the problem is unnecessary. The ideas may be seen as forming a complimentary and arguably simpler approach to Azevedo and Valentino that have the potential to be assimilated and adapted to pedagogical needs of those learning and teaching exact differential equations in schools, colleges, universities and polytechnics.

		"abstract": "This study is an investigation of students’ reasoning about integer comparisons—a topic that is often counterintuitive for students because negative numbers of smaller absolute value are considered greater (e.g., −5 > − 6). We posed integer-comparison tasks to 40 students each in Grades 2, 4, and 7, as well as to 11th graders on a successful mathematics track. We coded for correctness and for students’ justifications, which we categorized in terms of 3 ways of reasoning: magnitude-based, order-based, and developmental/other. The 7th graders used order-based reasoning more often than did the younger students, and it more often led to correct answers; however, the college-track 11th graders, who responded correctly to almost every problem, used a more balanced distribution of order- and magnitude-based reasoning. We present a framework for students’ ways of reasoning about integer comparisons, report performance trends, rank integer-comparison tasks by relative difficulty, and discuss implications for integer instruction.

		"abstract": "Preparing students with 21st Century Skills through STEM related teaching is needed, especially at the elementary level. However, most teacher education preparation programs do not focus on STEM education. To provide an exemplary STEM unit, we transformed an inquiry-based unit on moon phases from a traditional science activity into a technologyrich, digital unit for pre-service teachers (PSTs). In this paper, we describe lessons learned related to the development and implementation of this STEM unit in an undergraduate elementary methods course. We explore the impact of this on PSTs' perceptions of inquiry-based science instruction. Findings indicate that PSTs held absolutist beliefs and had a need for instruction on inquiry-based learning prior to engaging in an on-going inquiry. In addition, we determined that explicit examples of effective and ineffective technology use are needed to help PSTs develop an understanding of meaningful technology integration. Finally, our design approach resulted in a successful modification of the unit, but caused the usability of our digital instructional materials to suffer. Findings suggest that inquiry-based STEM units can be implemented in existing programs; however, development requires significant effort and requires that designs be tested for successful implementation.

		"abstract": "This paper presents two studies of an intervention designed to help undergraduates comprehend mathematical proofs. The intervention used multimedia resources that presented proofs with audio commentary and visual animations designed to focus attention on logical relationships. In study 1, students studied an e-Proof or a standard written proof and their comprehension was assessed in both immediate and delayed tests; the groups performed similarly at immediate test, but the e-Proof group exhibited poorer retention. Study 2 accounted for this unexpected result by using eye-movement analyses to demonstrate that participants who studied an e-Proof exhibited less processing effort when not listening to the audio commentary. We suggest that the extra support offered by e-Proofs disrupts the processes by which students organise information, and thus restricts the extent to which their new understanding is integrated with existing knowledge. We discuss the implications of these results for evaluating teaching innovations and for supporting proof comprehension. © 2017, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "Graduate student teaching assistants (GTAs) usually teach introductory level courses at the undergraduate level. Since GTAs constitute the majority of future mathematics faculty, their image of effective teaching and preparedness to lead instructional improvements will impact future directions in undergraduate mathematics curriculum and instruction. In this paper, we argue for the need to support GTAs in improving their mathematical meanings of foundational ideas and their ability to support productive student thinking. By investigating GTAs’ meanings for average rate of change, a key content area in precalculus and calculus, we found evidence that even mathematically sophisticated GTAs possess impoverished meanings of this key idea. We argue for the need, and highlight one approach, for supporting GTAs to improve their understanding of foundational mathematical ideas and how these ideas are learned. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This study investigates how the use of calculators during high school mathematics courses is associated with student performance in introductory college calculus courses in the USA. Data were drawn from a nationally representative sample of 7087 students enrolled in college calculus at 134 colleges and universities. They included information about students’ demographics, standardized test scores, and high school mathematics course enrollment and performance. Factor analysis reduced ten items describing high school calculator usage to two composites: how extensively calculators were employed and teacher-imposed restrictions on their use. Hierarchical linear models predicted students’ college calculus grades, reported by their professor, while controlling for differences between colleges and student backgrounds. The more extensively students had used calculators in high school, the lower their grade in college calculus. However, students earned higher college calculus grades to the extent that their high school teachers had limited calculator use on quizzes and exams and had restricted calculator use until paper-and-pencil methods had been mastered, which offset the negative association of extensive calculator use with grades. The effect sizes of both calculator composites were very small. Overall, the findings raise doubts about any substantial long-term effects on college mathematics performance of calculator use in high school. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

		"abstract": "Flipped instruction is increasing in popularity, however research that moves beyond descriptions of its implementation in mathematics classes is lacking. We sought to better understand how students taking an introductory college algebra course used the resources provided within a flipped instructional model and how students viewed such resources as useful to their learning. Data from course activity records and student usage surveys were used to characterize the frequency of student access to course resources (e.g. video lectures and comprehension assessments) and students' perceptions of the usefulness of these resources. Students naturally fell into one of four categories with respect to video usage and success in the course. Students who employed videos as intended were successful in the class. Students rated watching videos and working on homework in class as the activities that best supported their learning. Students did not perceive group work and in-class presentations as helpful. Our findings have implications for other instructors implementing flipped instruction. We argue that while flipping collegiate mathematics courses has great potential, instructors need to explicitly attend to the design of the in-class components in order to maximize student learning. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

		"abstract": "In Zimbabwe, school pupils study matrix operations, a topic that is usually covered as part of linear algebra courses taken by most mathematics undergraduate students at university. In this study we focused on Zimbabwean teachers who were studying the topic at university while also teaching the topic to their high school pupils. The purpose of the study was to explore the mental conceptions of matrix operations concepts of a sample of 116 in-service mathematics teachers. The Action Process Object Schema (APOS) theoretical framework describes the development in understanding of mathematics concepts through the hierarchical growth of mental constructions called action, process, object and schema. The results showed that many of the participants had interiorized actions on matrix operations of addition, scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication into processes. However, more than 50% of the participants struggled with scalar multiplication of a row matrix by a column matrix. In terms of notational errors, some participants could not distinguish between brackets that denote a matrix and that of a determinant, while some used the equal sign as an operator symbol and not as one denoting equivalence between two objects. It is recommended that future in-service teacher programs should try to create more structured opportunities to allow participants to engage more deeply with these concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Based on these responses, the instructor makes a number of changes (for example, the use of ‘cloze’ summary notes and the introduction of an extra, optional tutorial class) before repeating the ‘flipped classroom’ approach the following year.

This activity entails reflecting on and systematizing their own language use across diverse semantic content. We present categories of students’ untrained strategies for assessing the truth-values for mathematical disjunctions. Students’ initial reasoning heavily reflected content-specific and pragmatic factors in ways inconsistent with the norms and conventions of mathematical logic. Despite this, all student groups reinvented the standard truth-functional definition for simple disjunctions. We demonstrate how this learning depended upon particular forms of reasoning about logic. We also contrast various strategies for assessing quantified disjunctions and their different affordances in students’ mathematical activity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

		"abstract": "This paper is about a teaching experiment (TE) with inservice secondary teachers (hereafter “participants”) in the theory of systems of linear equations. The TE was oriented within particular social and intellectual climates, and its design and implementation took into consideration a series of findings concerning the difficulties students have in linear algebra. The questions we set for this study were: (1) Did the participants in the particular TE climates construct viable knowledge in the theory of systems of linear equations? Our criteria for viable knowledge consist in evidence for the ability to (a) generate non-trivial conjectures, judged so subjectively by a mathematician, (b) prove such conjecture, and (c) move upward along the APOS conception levels. (2) What difficulties and insights did the participants experience as they constructed such knowledge? The potential contributions of our investigation into these questions to researchers and practitioners include (a) a detailed depiction of the participants’ achievements and challenges in dealing with theoretical questions concerning linear systems in an authentic learning environment and under a tutelage oriented in a particular constructivist perspective; and (b) a field-based hypothesis about the consequences of a particular learning environment vis-à-vis construction of knowledge in linear algebra. All of the participants had taken a linear algebra course as part of their undergraduate studies, on average 17 years prior to the TE, with an average grade of about 80%. Thus, a third question set for this study concerns retention. (3) What did the participants retain from their linear algebra courses vis-à-vis concepts, ideas, and problem solving pertaining to the theory of systems of linear equations, assuming they had constructed such knowledge during these courses?

We report on an 18-hour intervention in a teacher education course at the undergraduate level attended by 12 participants during the fall of 2013. The goal of the intervention was to enhance participants’ CAC in the case of Elementary Arithmetic Theorems by using the rationality construct derived from Habermas’ work. Qualitative analyses of participants’ discussions showed how the construct was gradually appropriated by them and contributed to their CAC. Trends emerging from quantitative comparisons with previous implementations of the same course provided some evidence regarding the effects of the intervention on the quality of participants’ CAC performances at the end of the course. The method chosen for participants’ assessment and their cultural background will be discussed as conditions for the success of the intervention. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

We intend to reframe the relationship between reasoning and logic by showing how logic emerges within students' mathematical activity. This activity entails reflecting on and systematizing their own language use across diverse semantic content. We present categories of students' untrained strategies for assessing the truth-values for mathematical disjunctions. Students' initial reasoning heavily reflected content-specific and pragmatic factors in ways inconsistent with the norms and conventions of mathematical logic. Despite this, all student groups reinvented the standard truth-functional definition for simple disjunctions. We demonstrate how this learning depended upon particular forms of reasoning about logic. We also contrast various strategies for assessing quantified disjunctions and their different affordances in students' mathematical activity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This paper reports a mixed-methods, causal-comparative study of two instructional approaches in a differential equations course for engineering undergraduates. One classroom emphasized decontextualized techniques to solve canonical differential equations. The other classroom emphasized modeling principles to derive and interpret canonical differential equations as models of real world phenomena. Both classrooms were lecture based. This paper presents a brief review of both texts and compares a lesson on the same topic from each classroom in order to illustrate what it means to emphasize modeling principles. An ANCOVA was used to compare student performance on common final exam items while controlling for prior mathematics achievement. The main effect for instructional approach was statistically significant suggesting that a modeling perspective for teaching differential equations aided student learning.

		"abstract": "This article describes a sequence of design research projects, some exploratory others more formal, on the teaching of modelling and the analysis of modelling skills. The initial motivation was the author’s observation that the teaching of applied mathematics in UK high schools and universities involved no active modelling by students, but was entirely focused on their learning standards models of a restricted range of phenomena, largely from Newtonian mechanics. This did not develop the numeracy/mathematical literacy that was so clearly important for future citizens. Early explorations started with modelling workshops with high school teachers and mathematics undergraduates, observed and analysed—in some case using video. The theoretical basis of this work has been essentially heuristic, though the Shell Centre studies included, for example, a detailed analysis of formulation processes that has not, as so often, been directly replicated. Recent work has focused on developing a formative assessment approach to teaching modelling that has proved both successful and popular. Finally, the system-level challenges in trying to establish modelling as an integral part of mathematics curricula are briefly discussed. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2017.",

		"abstract": "The current study addresses student perceptions of math and science professors in the Middle East. Gender disparity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education continues to exist in higher education, with male professors holding a normative position. This disparity can also be seen in the United Arab Emirates. As female participation in STEM education lags behind men, it is possible that gender stereotypes may influence students’ first impressions of male and female instructors. The United Arab Emirates provides a unique context to study this phenomenon as it is a traditional patriarchal society that is highly dependent on the engineering discipline, especially within the oil and gas sectors. A total of 176 undergraduate students from 2 universities in the United Arab Emirates completed a survey about teaching effectiveness based on their perceptions of photographs of hypothetical male and female instructors. A factor analysis of survey items revealed 2 main subcategories of teacher effectiveness: namely teacher warmth and professionalism. A 2-way between-groups analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact of teacher gender and student gender on perceptions of overall teaching effectiveness, as well as their perceptions of teacher warmth and professionalism. Findings revealed that there was a significant cross-gender effect on student perceptions of math and science instructors in the United Arab Emirates. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "This article suggests that logic puzzles, such as the well-known Tower of Hanoi puzzle, can be used to introduce computer science concepts to mathematics students of all ages. Mathematics teachers introduce their students to computer science concepts that are enacted spontaneously and subconsciously throughout the solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. These concepts include, but are not limited to, conditionals, iteration, and recursion. Lessons, such as the one proposed in this article, are easily implementable in mathematics classrooms and extracurricular programmes as they are good candidates for ‘drop in’ lessons that do not need to fit into any particular place in the typical curriculum sequence. As an example for readers, the author describes how she used the puzzle in her own Number Sense and Logic course during the federally funded Upward Bound Math/Science summer programme for college-intending low-income high school students. The article explains each computer science term with real-life and mathematical examples, applies each term to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle solution, and describes how students connected the terms to their own solutions of the puzzle. It is timely and important to expose mathematics students to computer science concepts. Given the rate at which technology is currently advancing, and our increased dependence on technology in our daily lives, it has become more important than ever for children to be exposed to computer science. Yet, despite the importance of exposing today's children to computer science, many children are not given adequate opportunity to learn computer science in schools. In the United States, for example, most students finish high school without ever taking a computing course. Mathematics lessons, such as the one described in this article, can help to make computer science more accessible to students who may have otherwise had little opportunity to be introduced to these increasingly important concepts. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This mixed-methods study describes classroom characteristics and student outcomes from university mathematics courses that are based in mathematics departments, targeted to future pre-tertiary teachers, and taught with inquiry-based learning (IBL) approaches. The study focused on three two-term sequences taught at two research universities, separately targeting elementary and secondary pre-service teachers. Classroom observation established that the courses were taught with student-centred methods that were comparable to those used in IBL courses for students in mathematics-intensive fields at the same institutions. To measure pre-service teachers' gains in mathematical knowledge for teaching, we administered the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) instrument developed by Hill, Ball and Schilling for in-service teacher professional development. Results from the LMT show that pre-service teachers made significant score gains from beginning to end of their course, while data from interviews and from surveys of learning gains show that pre-service teachers viewed their gains as relevant to their future teaching work. Measured changes on pre-/post-surveys of attitudes and beliefs were generally supportive of learning mathematics but modest in magnitude. The study is distinctive in applying the LMT to document pre-service teachers' growth in mathematical knowledge for teaching. The study also suggests IBL is an approach well suited to mathematics departments seeking to strengthen their pre-service teacher preparation offerings in ways consistent with research-based recommendations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

Although both groups of faculty justify their decisions in similar ways, the way in which they talk differs. We used systemic functional linguistics to describe the differences we observed: part-time faculty’s language is more tentative, which hints at their tenuous status in their institutions. These findings may explain the negative perception in scholarship towards part-time faculty but such perception might not be justified in the classroom.

		"abstract": "This report examines teachers’ self-espoused attitudes and beliefs on proving in the secondary mathematics classroom. Conclusions were based on a questionnaire of 78 US mathematics teachers who had completed at least 2 years of teaching mathematics at the secondary level. While these teachers placed importance on proving as a general mathematical skill, when they discuss their own classrooms, procedural skill consistently surpasses proof-related activities in importance for a majority of high school teachers. Furthermore, teachers labeling their own past experiences in proving as causing anxiety are predictably more likely to put less value on proving. Interestingly, the quantity of past college mathematics courses is a reverse predictor indicating that further study should consider how students perceptions of proving change as they pass through a mathematics major. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "As part of a dramatic recent shift in tertiary education, many undergraduate students now learn mathematics via fully online courses. At present, the mathematics education research community knows very little about this shift, and in this report, we consider implications of an investigation into the instructor experience of fully online undergraduate mathematics courses. To compare instructor experiences of fully online and face-to-face teaching, we explored assessment schemes, feedback processes, and approaches to teaching using a survey and semistructured interviews. The main emergent theme was instructor concern about the loss of short-cycle face-to-face human interaction. We argue that this concern is serious but should be seen as an opportunity for education researchers to leverage knowledge about effective mathematics teaching to simultaneously alleviate instructors' difficulties and promote and study pedagogical development.

		"abstract": "Growing awareness of the importance of modelling activities in mathematics education has raised the question of whether teachers are prepared to facilitate the engagement of students in such activities. The current study investigates the effects of how teachers cope with modelling activities in developing their abilities to identify modelling cycles. The research was conducted among 34 practicing teachers studying for master's degrees at a college of education. The data were collected from two reports and one reflection provided by the participants about a modelling activity conducted by a group of five sixth-grade students. The first report was submitted before the participants themselves dealt with the modelling activities, while the second report and the reflection were submitted after their participation in the modelling activities. The findings indicate that prior to participating in the activity most of the teachers described the students' participation in modelling activity as a linear process. The participating teachers noticed the final mathematical model and the mathematical results obtained from applying the model, but most of them ignored the realistic results, the validating process and the cyclical nature of the mathematical model's progress. However, after the practicing teachers participated in modelling activities as learners, their reports indicated that most were able to recognize all the modelling phases and to distinguish the cyclical processes of the progress of the mathematical models. Moreover, according to the analyses of the reflections, the participating teachers are aware of the changes in their descriptions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "In spite of sustained efforts tertiary institutions implement to try and improve student academic performance, the number of students succeeding in first-year mathematics courses remains disturbingly low. For most students, the gap between their mathematical capability and the competencies they are expected and need to develop to function effectively in these courses persists even after course instruction. In this study, an instrument for identifying and examining factors affecting student performance and success in a first-year Mathematics university course was developed and administered to 86 students. The overall Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for the questionnaire was found to be 0.916. Having identified variables from prior research known to affect student performance, factor analysis was used to identify variables exhibiting the greatest impact on student performance. The variables included prior academic knowledge, workload, student approaches to learning, assessment, student support teaching quality, methods and resources. From the analysis, students' perceptions of their workload emerged as the factor having the greatest impact on student's performance, followed by the matriculation examination score. The findings are discussed and strategies that can be used to improve teaching and contribute to student success in a first-year mathematics course in a South African context are presented. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "Student attitudes toward mathematics play an important role in the teaching and learning processes of mathematics as positive attitudes correlate with higher student achievement. This paper aims to develop and explore the validity of a Chinese version of the short attitudes toward mathematics inventory (short ATMI) for Taiwanese undergraduates, and further to examine the measurement invariance across gender. The results suggest that, based on the Taiwanese sample, the model with some items excluded has better fit indices than the original model. The generalization of the four-factor construct was also confirmed. The Cronbach’s alpha for total and subscales of the modified short ATMI were satisfactory, and moreover, convergent and discriminant validity were shown. Finally, measurement invariance of the inventory across gender was also demonstrated. This study suggests that the Chinese version of the short ATMI is a reliable, valid, and compact instrument that quickly and efficiently measures student attitudes toward mathematics. © 2015, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",

		"abstract": "Graduate teaching assistants serve as instructors of record for numerous undergraduate courses every semester, including serving as teachers for mathematics content courses for elementary preservice teachers. In this study, we examine 6 teaching assistants' teaching practices in the context of a geometry content course for preservice teachers by focusing on their enactment of reasoning-and-proving tasks. Results indicate that teaching assistants engaged preservice teachers in a variety of reasoning-and-proving activities. For 42 of 82 tasks observed, preservice teachers' engagement in reasoningand- proving processes decreased relative to the potential for reasoning and proving in mathematical tasks. This investigation into teaching assistants' teaching practices identifies factors associated with their enactment of reasoning-and-proving tasks (e.g., generating student participation). This research has implications for professional development to support college mathematics instructors' teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This study investigated the achievement goals orientation of first year physics students at a South African university. The mixed methods design involved a quantitative survey of 291 students using an achievement goals questionnaire and individual interviews of selected participants. Results showed that the students perceived they have a stronger mastery goals orientation than performance goals and performance avoidance goals orientations. Multiple regression analysis in testing the mastery goals model indicated that the participants’ perceptions of teacher and peer goal emphases made the largest unique contribution to their orientation. It is suggested that at the tertiary level such an orientation should be promoted through learning experiences such as inquiry-based learning, which has been associated with this orientation. © 2014, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",

The study is based on survey results of 138 undergraduate mathematics students at a highly diverse urban public university. Survey measures included engagement in the Facebook group, access to Facebook, comfort using technology, and interest in the class. Quantitative analysis found that interest in the class and access to technology both positively correlate to engagement in a Facebook group. The results suggest that integrating a familiar technology in a novel way requires instructor effort, knowledge, and technique. Study findings are discussed in terms of the TPACK framework (technological pedagogical content knowledge), developed by Mishra & Koehler (2006), emphasizing the importance of instructor preparation for effective instructional technology integration.

		"abstract": "There is considerable variety in inquiry-oriented instruction, but what is common is that students assume roles in mathematical activity that in a traditional, lecture-based class are either assumed by the teacher (or text) or are not visible at all in traditional math classrooms. This paper is a case study of the teaching of an inquiry-based undergraduate abstract algebra course. In particular, gives a theoretical account of the defining and proving processes. The study examines the intellectual responsibility for the processes of defining and proving that the professor devolved to the students. While the professor wanted the students to engage in all aspects of defining and proving, he was only successful at devolving responsibility for certain aspects and much more successful at devolving responsibility for proving than conjecturing or defining. This study suggests that even a well-intentioned instructor may not be able to devolve responsibility to students for some aspects of mathematical practice without using a research-based curriculum or further professional development. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "Researchers point out the importance of teachers’ knowledge of student thinking and the role of examining student work in various contexts to develop a knowledge base regarding students’ ways of thinking. This study investigated prospective secondary mathematics teachers’ interpretations of students’ thinking as manifested in students’ work that embodied solutions of mathematical modelling tasks. The data were collected from 25 prospective mathematics teachers enrolled in an undergraduate course through four 2-week-long cycles. Analysis of data revealed that the prospective teachers interpreted students’ thinking in four ways: describing, questioning, explaining, and comparing. Moreover, whereas some of the prospective teachers showed a tendency to increase their attention to the meaning of students’ ways of thinking more while they engaged in students’ work in depth over time and experience, some of them continued to focus on only judging the accuracy of students’ thinking. The implications of the findings for understanding and developing prospective teachers’ ways of interpreting students’ thinking are discussed. © 2016, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",

It deals with a short history of different kinds of natural numbers including triangular, square, pentagonal, hexagonal and k-gonal numbers, and their simple properties and their geometrical representations. Included are Euclid's and Pythagorean's main contributions to elementary number theory with the main contents of the Euclid Elements of the 13-volume masterpiece of mathematical work. This is followed by Euler's new discovery of the additive number theory based on partitions of numbers. Special attention is given to many examples, Euler's theorems on partitions of numbers with geometrical representations of Ferrers’ graphs, Young's diagrams, Lagrange's four-square theorem and the celebrated Waring problem. Included are Euler's generating functions for the partitions of numbers, Euler's pentagonal number theorem, Gauss’ triangular and square number theorems and the Jacobi triple product identity. Applications of the theory of partitions of numbers to different statistics such as the Bose– Einstein, Fermi– Dirac, Gentile, and Maxwell– Boltzmann statistics are briefly discussed. Special attention is given to pedagogical information through historical approach to number theory so that students and teachers at the school, college and university levels can become familiar with the basic concepts of partitions of numbers, partition functions and their modern applications, and can pursue advanced study and research in analytical and computational number theory. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

The WVU Department of Mathematics has been tasked with remediating these students and has worked over the last decade to find the most efficient way to teach the Pre-College Algebra Workshop; the prerequisite course students must complete (if unable to test into college mathematics) to enroll in College Algebra. The course was originally delivered as a traditional lecture and was later migrated to a self-paced hybrid format and has been recently redesigned. In this paper we describe three structures of the course over a six and a half year period and present student success data. We look not only at how students perform in the Pre-College Algebra Workshop but also in their subsequent mathematics courses after having completed the different version of the Pre-College Algebra Workshop in which they were enrolled to determine the efficacy of programmatic changes.

		"abstract": "One goal of an undergraduate education in mathematics is to help students develop a productive disposition towards mathematics. A way of conceiving of this is as helping mathematical novices transition to more expert-like perceptions of mathematics. This conceptualization creates a need for a way to characterize students' perceptions of mathematics in authentic educational settings. This article presents a survey, the Mathematics Attitudes and Perceptions Survey (MAPS), designed to address this need. We present the development of the MAPS instrument and its validation on a large (N = 3411) set of student data. Results from various MAPS implementations corroborate results from analogous instruments in other STEM disciplines. We present these results and highlight some in particular: MAPS scores correlate with course grades; students tend to move away from expert-like orientations over a semester or year of taking a mathematics course; and interactive-engagement type lectures have less of a negative impact, but no positive impact, on students' overall orientations than traditional lecturing. We include the MAPS instrument in this article and suggest ways in which it may deepen our understanding of undergraduate mathematics education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "This research investigates the effects of socioscientific instruction on pre-service teachers’ sense of efficacy in the teaching and learning of controversial family health issues. For this purpose, a total of 251 students from two teacher training colleges participated in the study and were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. The experimental group was taught the contents of the controversial family health issues using socioscientific instruction approach and the control group was taught the same content using a more traditional approach. Quantitative data were obtained from both groups after responding to the ‘Teacher sense of Efficacy Scale’ as instrument used for data collection before and after the treatments. Analysis of covariance was used in data analysis of which the pre-treatment scores were used as covariates. Qualitative interviews were conducted with ten participants randomly selected from the experimental group before and after the treatment to deepen and elaborate the quantitative data. The quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that the integration of the socioscientific instruction have significantly affected the pre-service teachers’ sense of efficacy in favour of the experimental group that shows a more stronger sense of efficacy. It was concluded that the socioscientific instruction is significantly effective in changing the pre-service teachers’ weaker sense of efficacy to a stronger one in the controversial family health issues. © 2014, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: This article reports on a study investigating how postsecondary students interact with mathematical proofs with a focus on how they go about unpacking a “received proof,” how they make meaning from what they are given, and whether they believe that mathematical meaning can be drawn from such proofs. Case studies were conducted with seven non-mathematics majors of varying mathematical competence. Data sources included semistructured interviews aimed at exploring their knowledge, beliefs, and learning approach regarding received mathematical proofs. This included engaging them in “proof mapping.” The findings discussed here are based on two of the participants who had seen some basic mathematics proofs and their beliefs about received proofs. The study shows that though both students displayed a respect for proofs, their beliefs indicated that they had not received or understood their importance in mathematics education. Moreover, they believed that their efforts to engage with received proofs are largely self-created, based on modeling classroom discussions. Implications are discussed for teaching through received proofs. © 2015, © OISE.",

		"abstract": "Research suggests it is difficult to learn mathematics in the fully asynchronous online (FAO) instructional modality, yet little is known about associated teaching and assessment practices. In this study, we investigate FAO mathematics assessment and feedback practices in particular consideration of both claims and findings that these practices have a powerful influence on learning. A survey questionnaire was constructed and completed by 70 FAO undergraduate mathematics instructors, mostly from the USA, who were each asked to detail their assessment and feedback practices in a single FAO mathematics course. Alongside these questions, participants also answered the 16-item version of the Approaches to Teaching Inventory. In addition, a novel feedback framework was also created and used to examine how feedback practices may be related to participants' approaches to teaching. Results show that assessment and feedback practices are varied and complex: in particular, we found there was not a simple emphasis on summative assessment instruments, nor a concomitant expectation these would always be invigilated. Though richer assessment feedback appears to be emphasized, evidence suggests this feedback may not be primarily directed at advancing student learning. Moreover, we found evidence of a reliance on computer--human interactions (e.g. via computer-assisted assessment systems) and further evidence of a decline in human interactions, suggesting a dynamic that is both consistent with current online learning theory and claims FAO mathematics courses are becoming commodified. Several avenues for further research are suggested. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "The construct 'mathematical knowledge for teaching' (MKT) has received considerable attention in the mathematics education community in recent years. The development and refinement of the MKT construct, including the components of common content knowledge (CCK) and specialized content knowledge (SCK), came from research into elementary teachers' practices. In this article, we argue that various issues arise as these constructs are used in research on secondary and post-secondary teachers. For example, elementary teachers typically differ from teachers of higher grades in their content preparation. What then is the relationship of CCK to SCK for those holding a bachelors degree or higher in mathematics? The MKT construct is based on CCK being knowledge held or used by an average mathematically literate citizen and that SCK is different. However, among those teaching in secondary and post-secondary contexts, what should be considered CCK? Is conceptual understanding of the CCK among those with bachelor's degrees or higher level mathematics the same as SCK? We examine these questions as well as others that arose from our examination of definitions of CCK and SCK as we attempted to utilize those definitions to characterize the nature of MKT at secondary and undergraduate levels. We illustrate these issues with data from two instructional settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify variables related to success and resilience in an undergraduate, high school mathematics teacher education program. Over a five-year period, we tracked the academic performance and achievement motivation goals of multiple cohorts of students. Students who successfully completed their degrees had higher grade point average (GPAs) upon entering the program, earned higher grades in their first college mathematics course, and failed fewer courses than students who left the program or university. Learning and performance motivational goals did not predict success in the program. Performance goals decreased over time. Nearly half the successful students repeated one or more mathematics courses. Ten students completed their degrees, obtained a teaching license, and are teaching despite the need for multiple repetitions of the same mathematics courses. These persistent students did not differ from their peers in motivational goals. Our results suggest that although students with higher GPAs and initial mathematics grades were more likely to complete the program, students who experienced challenges in mathematics courses were able to succeed. We discuss the implications of these results for recruiting, advising, and retention of students in mathematics education programs.",

We contribute to these efforts by expanding the constructs in Cobb and Yackel's (Educational Psychologist 31:175-190, ) interpretive framework that allow for coordinating social and individual perspectives. This expansion involves four different constructs: disciplinary practices, classroom mathematical practices, individual participation in mathematical activity, and mathematical conceptions that individuals bring to bear in their mathematical work. We illustrate these four constructs for making sense of students' mathematical progress using data from an undergraduate mathematics course in linear algebra. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This research investigates what students' use of statistical language can tell us about their conceptions of distribution and sampling in relation to informal inference. Prior research documents students' challenges in understanding ideas of distribution and sampling as tools for making informal statistical inferences. We know that these ideas are complex and difficult for students, but little is known about the ways in which students' language mediates their statistical problem-solving activities within the realm of distribution, sampling, and informal inference. This study uses examples from semi-structured interviews with eleven undergraduate students from two universities. Interview tasks focused on (1) distinctions between distributions of populations, samples, and sample statistics; (2) properties of sampling distributions; and (3) how to use sampling distributions to make informal inferences. Analysis focused on students' use of metonymy (i.e., the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing or idea meant). We observed two particular metonymies. The first was a paradigmatic metonymy in which students applied the properties of the normal distribution to all distributions. Second, we observed a proper metonymy in which students talked about sampling distributions as compilations of many samples. The potential impact of these metonymies on students' ability to solve problems and the implications for teaching are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

With this research goal in mind, we conducted a study exploring various implementations of the flipped classroom model by interviewing 19 faculty members who experienced using this model at 14 different institutes. Results indicate that participants had similar motivations for implementation; however, subsequent implementations were different. In addition, we share participants' perspectives on (a) student learning of pre-requisite, procedural and conceptual knowledge, and (b) how this particular model promotes such knowledge developments.

		"abstract": "This work describes the design and evaluation of a proposal to use Classroom Response Systems (CRS), intended to promote participative classes of Mathematics at University. The proposal is based on Problem Based Learning (PBL). The outcomes show that Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a relevant strategy in order to construct mathematical teaching- learning activities. These activities aimed to broaden the undergraduate students' mathematical experience by guiding their current deductive and algebraic conception towards an inductive and empirical one. In this context, it is proved that CRS allows establishing a fluid lecturer-students communication. The strategy generates a working atmosphere that students like and leads to greater learning compared to what is obtained using conventional university teaching. In addition, the proposed methodology has a very wide scope, so it might be used for the teaching-learning of other disciplines different than Mathematics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Participants were 79 undergraduate pre-service teachers who were enrolled into the university core program and the teacher education program where the former offered a content course and the latter the methods course. A paper-based survey was distributed to the students to collect data. Quantitative analysis was utilized to analyze the collect data. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in content knowledge for algebra between the pre-service teachers from two programs. Pre-service teachers in the teacher education program had better pedagogical knowledge than those in the university core program. The five sub-scales of the algebra content were significantly correlated with each other. Content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge significantly predicted TPACK. Levels of technology skills among the pre-service teachers had a significant impact on their technology knowledge, technological content knowledge and TPACK.",

This research examines the knowledge demands placed on 73 pre-service primary teachers as they use lesson study to plan and teach data handling in primary classrooms. Pre-service teachers are observed as they plan, teach and re-teach data lessons in classrooms. Problems of practice are identified and categorized using the Ball, Thames and Phelps (2008) subdomains of common content knowledge (CCK), specialized content knowledge (SCK), knowledge of content and students (KCS) and knowledge of content and teaching (KCT). The results provide insights into the specific knowledge demands placed on early career teachers when teaching data and statistics and identifies foci area that can be addressed in teacher preparation programs. The results illustrate that development of understandings in one knowledge subdomain can motivate and impact learning in another subdomain. These interrelationships were found to exist both within and between the domains of content and pedagogical content knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Many students enter the Canadian college system with insufficient mathematical ability and leave the system with little improvement. Those students who enter with poor mathematics ability typically take a developmental mathematics course as their first and possibly only mathematics course. The educational experiences that comprise a developmental mathematics course vary widely and are, too often, ineffective at improving students’ ability. This trend is concerning, since low mathematics ability is known to be related to lower rates of success in subsequent courses. To date, little attention has been paid to the selection of an instructional approach to consistently apply across developmental mathematics courses. Prior research suggests that an appropriate instructional method would involve explicit instruction and practising mathematical procedures linked to a mathematical concept. This study reports on a randomized field trial of a developmental mathematics approach at a college in Ontario, Canada. The new approach is an adaptation of the JUMP Math program, an explicit instruction method designed for primary and secondary school curriculae, to the college learning environment. In this study, a subset of courses was assigned to JUMP Math and the remainder was taught in the same style as in the previous years. We found consistent, modest improvement in the JUMP Math sections compared to the non-JUMP sections, after accounting for potential covariates. The findings from this randomized field trial, along with prior research on effective education for developmental mathematics students, suggest that JUMP Math is a promising way to improve college student outcomes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

Even more, the trend to include CAS and DGS in the curricula of some undergraduate studies has resulted in the instruction of the software that must be used in the teaching process. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of the use of CAS and DGS in higher education. We propose a new approach presenting four possible uses in and out of the classroom, in order to encourage teachers and students to use them in some topics related to variational thinking: (i) to assist in the mathematical reasoning to identify mathematical expressions; (ii) as an aid to understand concepts; (Hi) as a didactic resource for self-learning; and (iv) as a facilitator for the recognition of data from 3D drawings. Based on Piaget's and Bruner's cognitive theories, we suggest the use of apps which could be employed to improve the comprehension of selected mathematical topics, to allow students to acquire the mathematical competencies to better understand the concepts involved in them, as well as to promote the development of variational thinking.

We conducted a survey to investigate why some students choose to attend lectures in person rather than simply watching the recordings online, and how students view the two types of lectures. Students attending live lectures in five large undergraduate mathematics lecture streams were invited to respond to the survey. A significant number of respondents viewed recorded lecture as superfluous to their needs which were met upon attending live lecture. Surprisingly, however, an equally large number of students described compelling reasons for watching both live and recorded lectures. A number of factors were identified as determining students' perceptions of live and recorded lectures as competing or complementary: personal learning styles, study habits, esteem for the lecturer, and the possibility of interaction in the lecture. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

The article discusses important aspects related to online mathematics courses offered in higher education programs, including: benefits and challenges, universities offering this type of education, methodological considerations, emergent technologies, learning projects and environments, etc. Also, key aspects of the UOC mathematical e-learning model and its historical evolution are described and analysed. Special attention is paid to mathematical curricula in computer sciences degrees, where a lot of work needs to be done in order to adapt mathematics courses to the continuously changing educational necessities of students. A curricula design proposal, based on a top-down approach, is presented as a best practice. Finally, some trends and future perspectives on the subject are suggested.

Based on evidence from university classrooms and the result of an initial measurement, the genetic decomposition designed by Dubinsky and Lewin for this concept was reformulated, introducing and defining the basis step in the PMI as a mental process. Using this reformulated genetic decomposition, the productions of four university students are analysed in order to support or refute the constructions it proposes. The results show that the reformulated genetic decomposition is viable and that the inclusion of the basis step as a mental process was seen in the cognitive model of the PMI shown by the students. The instruments used provide activities for a teaching sequence for the PMI at university level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This paper reports a classroom-based study involving investigation activities in a university numerical analysis course. The study aims to analyse students' mathematical processes and to understand how these activities provide opportunities for problem posing. The investigations were intended to stimulate students in asking questions, to trigger their thinking processes, to promote their ability to investigate and to support them in learning numerical analysis' concepts and procedures. The results show that the investigations provided opportunities for students to experience mathematical processes, including posing questions, formulating and testing conjectures and, to some extent, proving results. They also provide some understanding about the role of problem posing in these processes. Posing questions occurred mainly in an implicit way, in the interpretation of tasks and in identifying regularities, analysing graphs and testing cases. The conjectures were often based on pattern identification or data manipulation, and the students tended to accept them without testing or proving. The students also proposed alternative formulations for the initial questions and posed new problems from their explorations and attempts to refine previous conjectures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Since then, technology has moved forward, both in terms of its sophistication and pedagogical potential; and learner experiences, preferences and ways of thinking have changed dramatically. Based on the authors' previous work and a literature review, this article revisits the subject of enhancing mathematics education through educational robotics kits and virtual robotic animations by proposing their simultaneous deployment at the school-university transition. The rationale for such an application is argued and an evaluation framework for these technologies is proposed. Two educational robotic kits and a virtual environment supporting robotic animations are evaluated both in terms of their feasibility of deployment and their educational effectiveness. Finally, the evaluation of learning experiences when deploying the proposed pedagogical approach is discussed. (Contains 2 figures.)",

		"abstract": "The Australian Federal Government and Australian universities have embarked on a bid to raise the profile of learning and teaching (L&T) in universities. Current strategies include increased funding of competitive grants for L&T projects, a wider range of teaching awards and fellowships and a controversial new national competitive Learning and Teaching Performance Fund. Despite these initiatives, advertised positions still target strong researchers, rather, and rewards for L&T initiatives are meagre. To assess the likely impact of these efforts, this report offers findings on the L&T culture among two distinct groups of Australian science, technology and engineering academics: a comparison of the research and L&T behaviours and attitudes of 22 senior academics, and the L&T perceptions and needs reported by 32 academics across all levels. The results are unequivocal: (1) senior academics still perceive that there are far higher professional rewards for research activities than for L&T activity, place far higher value on research leadership roles than L&T leadership, and gain far more job satisfaction from research activities. Moreover, they feel that their seniors support and encourage them far more strongly for research efforts than for L&T efforts; (2) academics at all levels still experience a lack of role models, support and reward for L&T activities; and resent L&T policies that neglect discipline-specific needs. The implications are clear. Unless rewards and support for L&T activities become comparable to those for research, and mainstream job opportunities materialize for academics who invest substantial time in L&T activities, national and institutional rhetoric strategies to encourage L&T activity will continue to be judged as window-dressing and be received with cynicism; and changes in academic behaviour will be marginal.

		"abstract": "• Only one student constructed a three-dimensional object conception within the framework of genetic decomposition. • Some students could not relate the concept of two-variable function to three-dimensional space. • The students who could perform algebraic operations had problems as far as geometric representation was concerned. Conceptual understanding is being emphasized in mathematics education. Students often have difficulty understanding the multi-variable function, a key concept. Based on the APOS theory, which analyzes the cognitive structures formed by individuals in learning a mathematical concept and produces components related to that learning, this study analyzes the conceptual understanding of three-dimensional spaces and two-variable functions by university students. The genetic decomposition of these concepts proposed by Trigueros and Martinez-Planell is also considered. The analyzes results revealed that only one student constructed the concept of three-dimensional space as an object within the framework of genetic decomposition. Some students could not relate the concepts of two-variable function and three-dimensional space. Students who could perform algebraic operations had problems related to geometric representation. This study suggests the refinement of genetic decomposition to include, e.g., mental construction steps for writing algebraic equations of special surfaces whose graphs are given in R3.

We found four erroneous images of inflection points: (1) f ' (x) = 0 as a necessary condition, (2) f ' (x) is not equal to 0 as a necessary condition, (3) f \" (x) = 0 as a sufficient condition, and (4) the location of \"a peak point, where the graph bends\" as an inflection point.

The focus was on what knowledge the student retained 14 months after the course and on what effect beliefs about mathematics had on the retention. We argue that if a student can quickly reconstruct the knowledge, given a few hints, this is just as good as retention. The study was conducted using a mixed method approach investigating students' knowledge in three worlds of mathematics. The results showed that the student had a very low retention of concepts, even after hints. However, after completing the calculus course, the student had successfully used calculus in a physical chemistry study programme. Hence, using calculus in new contexts does not in itself strengthen the original calculus learnt; they appeared as disjoint bodies of knowledge.",

		"abstract": "Non-mathematics specialists' competence and confidence in mathematics in their disciplines have been highlighted as in need of improvement. We report from a collaborative, developmental research project which explores the conjecture that greater integration of mathematics and biology in biology study programs, for example through engaging students with Mathematical Modeling (MM) activities, is one way to achieve this improvement. We examine the evolution of 12 first-semester biology students' mathematical discourse as they engage with such activities in four sessions which ran concurrently with their mandatory mathematics course and were taught by a mathematician with extensive experience with MM. The sessions involved brief introductions to different aspects of MM, followed by small-group work on tasks set in biological contexts. Our analyses use the theory of commognition to investigate the tensions between ritualized and exploratory participation in the students' MM activity. We focus particularly on a quintessential routine in MM, assumption building: we trace attempts which start from ritualized engagement in the shape of \"guesswork\" and evolve into more productively exploratory formulations. We also identify signs of persistent commognitive conflict in the students' activity, both intra-mathematical (concerning what is meant by a \"math task\") and extra-mathematical (concerning what constitutes a plausible solution to the tasks in a biological sense). Our analyses show evidence of the fluid interplay between ritualized and exploratory engagement in the students' discursive activity and contribute towards what we see as a much needed distancing from operationalization of the commognitive constructs of ritual and exploration as an unhelpfully dichotomous binary.

Two groups of students (54 in New Zealand and 50 in Germany) completed a questionnaire about their difficulties in solving the problem which was set as part of a mid-semester test. The research endeavoured to find reasons most of the students could not use their knowledge to construct a simple function in a familiar context.

		"abstract": "Following the political changes of 1994 in South Africa, the decision was taken to replace the traditional skills-based education system at primary and secondary school level (Grades 1-12) with an outcomes-based education system (OBE). The implementation of the OBE system did not come without problems, giving rise to revised initiatives. The OBE approach, referred to as Curriculum 2005, was introduced into schools in 1998, for all learners in Grades 1- 6 and progressively phased in after that. In 2002, the OBE system was put on hold for the two upper grades of these learners. Learners in these two grades reverted back to skills-based learning for their last three years of schooling, i.e. in Grades 10 - 12. The most senior of these learners that had been subjected to four years of OBE and another three years of the old system finished their schooling in 2005 and 2006 and entered university in 2006 and 2007. These groups are of interest. Students ahead of them had their full schooling in the old system and students two years younger were only subjected to OBE. These students are the \"group in the middle\". This paper reports on what the impact is of the growing pains of such a new, inadequately planned education system on the mathematics preparedness of students entering university. This report will be extended in 2009 when the learners that have been fully subjected to the OBE system enter university. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This article investigates the attitude toward mathematics among the students enrolled in the Foundation Year Programme at Nazarbayev University. The study is conducted quantitatively and an inventory developed by Tapia and Marsh II is adopted in this research. The inventory consists of 40 statements on the five-point Likert scale. Gender, specialization and final high school score in mathematics are collected. The number of valid returned questionnaires is 108. There are 55 males, 53 females, 73 Mathematical-Physics (MP), 22 Biology-Chemistry (BC) and 13 International Relations-Economics (IRE) students. Generally, they have a positive attitude toward mathematics, with the score mean and standard deviation are 3.999 and 0.531 out of five, respectively. We confirm a hypothesis on a positive correlation between previous high achievement in mathematics and favorable attitude toward it. The correlation value is r = 0.300, its effect size is medium and it is extremely significant (p-value = 0.0008 < 0.001). There is no significant difference between male and female students in terms of their attitude toward mathematics (t = 0.6804, p-value = 002489 > 0.05). There is a very significant difference between students who specialize in IRE and MP in terms of their attitude toward mathematics (F(2, 105) = 5.6848, p-value = 0.0045 < 0.01).",

		"abstract": "This study examines different factors' relative importance for students' performance in the transition to university mathematics. Students' characteristics (motivation, actions and beliefs) were measured when entering the university and at the end of the first year. Principal component analysis revealed four important constructs: \"Self-efficacy,\" \"Motivation type,\" \"Study habits\" and \"Views of mathematics.\" Subsequently, orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) analysis was used for measuring the constructs' ability to predict students' university mathematics grades. No individual constructs measured at the time of entrance predicted more than 5% of the variation. On the other hand, jointly they predicted 14%, which is almost in pair with upper secondary grades predicting 17%. Constructs measured at the end of the first year were stronger predictors, jointly predicting 37% of the variation in university grades, with Self-efficacy (21%) and Motivation (12%) being the two strongest individual predictors. In general, Study habits were not important for predicting university achievement. However, for students with low upper secondary grades, the textbook and interaction with peers, rather than internet-based resources, contributed positively to achievement. The association between Views of mathematics and performance was weak for all groups and non-existing for students with low grades.",

		"abstract": "This study focused on science and math professional learning communities (PLCs) that were implemented through a university-urban high school partnership. These PLCs were part of mandated school-wide, content-based PLCs implemented as part of the reform efforts initiated in an urban school to address the school's failure to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for four years consecutively and low graduation rate (less than 25%) for male students. The key issues were (a) students had continually earned low test scores; (b) there was continuous principal turnover; (c) faculty morale was at an all-time low, and the quality of teaching was very poor; and (d) the students were not effectively disciplined. The study examined the impact that university faculty-led mandated PLCs have on teachers' practices and students' learning and achievement. Analysis of data revealed practices that were effective in developing and implementing these successful math and science PLCs. Three themes emerged: ethics of care, teacher agency, and aesthetics of professional interactions. Each theme contained key features that appeared to contribute to the implementation of a successful PLC.",

In this paper we describe an application \"TalkMaths\" which, using the output from a commonly-used conventional automatic speech recognition system, enables the user to dictate mathematical expressions in a relatively straightforward way. These then get converted into electronic formats, so that they can be embedded in a document and/or displayed in an editor or web browser. This process can be used for preparing teaching material, assignments, or entering mathematical content for online tests. Our system does not require the user to have extensive knowledge of the syntax of any markup language or mathematical document specification language, so that learning to use it should be relatively straightforward for non-specialists. The way in which our system analyses, converts and encodes the spoken mathematical expressions is a novel approach. (Contains 4 figures.)",

This dilemma is illuminated from a theoretical point of view as well as from teacher and student perspectives. The data consist of university students' survey responses, transcripts of interviews with mathematicians and students as well as protocols of the observations of lectures, textbooks and other instructional material. The article shows that the combination of a socio-cultural perspective, Lave and Wenger's and Wenger's social practice theories and theories about proof offers a fresh framework for studies concerning the teaching and learning of proof.

Nevertheless, there is little information about teaching knowledge of mathematics university teachers. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) provides a suitable framework to study knowledge of teachers. The purpose of this paper is to make explicit the perception of mathematics university teachers about PCK. For this purpose, a phenomenological study was done. Data resources included semi-structured interviews with 10 mathematics university teachers who were in different places of the mathematics university teaching experience spectrum. Data analysis indicated a model consisting of four cognitive themes which are mathematics syntactic knowledge, knowledge about mathematics curriculum planning, knowledge about students' mathematics learning and knowledge about creating an influential mathematics teaching-learning environment. Besides, it was found out that three contextual themes influenced on PCK for teaching mathematics in university levels which were the nature of mathematics subjects, university teachers' features and terms of learning environment.",

The basic purpose of the research was to determine the students' images of the concept of limit, that is to find out their associations, conceptions and intuitions connected with limits and to determine the degree of their efficiency and the sources of their formation. To achieve the objectives an expanded set of selected problems — simple but not quite standard — and various other research instruments were used. Several classes of images of the limit concept have been identified and described, according to their main foci: neighborhoods, graph approaching, values approaching, being defined at x0, limit of f at x0 equals f(x0), and algorithms.

Participants were asked to complete a proof-related task before class, work together in small groups to evaluate fellow students’ arguments, communally agree upon criteria for evaluating said arguments based on their evaluations, and then rate and revise their original argument to satisfy the communal criteria after class. We used a modified analytical categorization of arguments to compare students’ before-class and after-class work. Results demonstrated that students’ self-rating aligned positively with the argument categories, but two critical challenges were also observed: (1) students’ self-rating of their arguments was not positively correlated with the class-acceptance rate of those arguments indicating that individual and communal perceptions of proof varied; and (2) students struggled to revise their arguments to align with the communal criteria.

The study is a German supplementary study to the international comparative TEDS-M 2008 study. Besides the pedagogical content knowledge that was longitudinally surveyed using instruments relating to TEDS-M 2008, the study examined additionally, in qualitatively-oriented interviews, what individual perceptions the future teachers have of courses on mathematics education. In the data nine different systematic perceptions could be identified that could be assigned to four different dimensions of courses on mathematics education. Through the integration of the different results the relationship between knowledge acquisition and perceptions is described, as exemplified by the cases of two future teachers. Hereby the future teachers' explanations provide an interpretive background for the development of their MPCK.",

We recognized that most of the students take the course for general knowledge and support of other majors, and very few are planning to major in statistics. We identified the essential aspects of a first-year statistics course, given this student mix, focusing on a simple question, \"Given this is the last chance you have to teach statistics, what are the essential skills students need?\" We have moved from thinking about statistics skills needed for a statistician to skills needed to participate in today's society. We have changed the way we deliver the course with less emphasis on lectures and more on alternative resources including on-line tutorials, Excel, computer-based skills testing, web-based learning materials and smaller group activities such as study groups and example classes. Feedback from students shows that they are very receptive and enthusiastic. (Contains 2 tables.)",

		"abstract": "This paper reports the results of a research exploring the mathematical connections of pre-university students while they solving tasks which involving rates of change. We assume mathematical connections as a cognitive process through which a person finds real relationships between two or more ideas, concepts, definitions, theorems, procedures, representations or meanings or with other disciplines or the real-world. Four tasks were proposed to the 33 pre-university students that participated in this research; the central concept of the first task is the slope, the last three tasks contain concepts like velocity, speed and acceleration. Task-based interviews were conducted to collect data and later analysed with thematic analysis. Results showed most of the students made mathematical connections of the procedural type, the mathematical connections of the common features type are made in smaller quantities and the mathematical connection of the generalization type is scarcely made. Furthermore, students considered slope as a concept disconnected from velocity, speed and acceleration.",

		"abstract": "This qualitative study surveyed 102 differential-equations students in order to investigate how students participating in writing projects in university-level mathematics courses perceive the benefits of writing in the mathematics classroom. Based on previous literature on writing in mathematics, students were asked specifically about the benefits of writing projects as a means to explore practical uses of mathematics, deepen content knowledge, and strengthen communication. Student responses indicated an awareness of these benefits, supporting justifications commonly cited by instructors assigning writing projects. Open-ended survey responses highlighted additional themes which students associated with writing in mathematics, including using software programs and technology, working in groups, and stimulating interest in mathematics. This study provides student feedback to support the use of writing projects in mathematics, as well as student input, which can be utilized to strengthen the impact of writing projects in mathematics.",

		"abstract": "Taking the example of teaching mathematical modelling in university degrees, this paper focuses on how the unit of analysis adopted by different research frameworks in mathematics education transforms a teaching problem into a research one. The transformation starts by including a specific way of conceiving not only the activity of modelling but also its possible evolutions and connections with more general mathematical or scientific activities. This epistemological dimension of the research problem can be enlarged by what we call the ecological dimension, that is, the set of conditions and constraints that allow or hinder the existence of specific mathematical activities, such as modelling, as normalised school practices, in particular, at the university. The institutional perspective adopted by the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic integrates both dimensions. This integration leads to the formulation of new research questions in the domain of modelling and applications and provides new tools to address them systematically. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "This study examines progression trends of Chinese students' scientific reasoning skills across grade levels from elementary school to university. A large-scale survey using the Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (CTSR) was conducted with 2669 Chinese students at 13 grade levels (grades 4-16). The construct validity of the CTSR was first examined using Rasch analysis to verify that the various reasoning sub-skills targeted by the test (hypothetical-deductive reasoning, proportional reasoning, correlation reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and control of variables) form a cohesive cognitive construct. Based on an affirmative result, we proceeded to fit grade-level averages to the best-fit logistic regression model and generated trend lines for the reasoning sub-skills measured by the CTSR. Results show that the cross-grade progression trends generally follow continuous paths through increasingly greater levels of improvement. While all sub-skills display a noticeable growth during middle and high school years, they progress across the grades with different rates. Specifically, the development of proportional reasoning is fast-paced and large, but the progression of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and control of variables is markedly tardy and small. Formal science instruction, particularly the emergence of multiple domain-specific science courses in middle and high school, can influence the cross-grade progression trends. Possible causes and future improvement in science education are proposed. This study contributes to our understanding about the development of scientific reasoning and offers important implications for science instruction and research at different grades.",

		"abstract": "In recent years in England, considerable attention has been given to a range of apparent crises in mathematics education, one of which has been the long term decline of participation in university-entrance level (Advanced or A level) mathematics. Given the negative impact upon mathematics participation of a national reform of Advanced level qualifications, commonly known as Curriculum 2000, together with the government's emphasis on science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM), the political intent to increase participation in Advanced level mathematics is clear. This paper uses the National Pupil Database (NPD) to develop a descriptive statistical account of how completion of Advanced level mathematics varies along the social axes of socioeconomic status, ethnicity and gender. The process of working with the NPD is discussed in some depth in order to clarify the processes involved in this type of quantitative analysis and then to illustrate how such analyses can be used to raise questions about who is studying mathematics in the post-16 age-range.

		"abstract": "Students are presented with problems involving three scenario types of addition and subtraction in elementary mathematics: one dynamic (\"Change\") and two static (\"Combine, Compare\"). Previous studies have indicated that the dynamic type is easier for school children, whereas the static types are more difficult and comprehended only gradually throughout elementary grades. However, these differences in scenario difficulty have not be adequately investigated in adults to ascertain whether they persist in adults who have used the operations for a long period of time. This study examined this with Japanese university students (ages 18-23 years). In Study 1, 99 participants were provided with one numerical equation and one picture representing one of the three scenario types, and were instructed to generate a single scenario. In Study 2, 97 participants were provided with one numerical equation and were instructed to recall the various scenario types that they had encountered previously and to generate multiple scenarios of diverse types. Results indicated that participants found the dynamic scenario types easier than static ones, and they tended to understand the given information of static types by interpreting them in dynamic forms (Study 1). In addition, they strongly preferred generating scenarios of dynamic type over static types (Study 2). Implications for mathematics learning are discussed. (Contains 6 tables.)",

		"abstract": "Our pre-university chemistry students face problems achieving sufficient quality in chemical inquiry. To try to enhance the quality of student performance in chemical inquiry, Dutch pre-university chemistry students (age 17) carried out an authentic research project on \"Diffusion of ions in distilled water.\" The learning materials for this student inquiry project, the teaching scenario and the website were designed in cooperation with five chemistry teachers. Three teachers from this network and two other teachers also implemented the project with 80 students to find out whether the emphasis on relevant concepts of evidence (CoE) improves the quality of student inquiry outcomes. This part--with its emphasis on the CoE--in the student inquiry task is based on four key features: the students feel motivated to explore, focus their attention on, give meaning to and reflect upon CoE. In teams students conducted a guide experiment, analysed a scientific article, did an inquiry and wrote a report, discussed CoE with peers on the Internet and rewrote their reports. All lessons were observed, field notes were made and analysed on whether the intended student activities had been realised. The Internet discussion was recorded in a database and analysed. The first and final reports of all teams were coded and analysed. Also the students' appreciation of the activities was assessed. The teaching and learning activities were realized to a very large extent as planned in the design. The emphasis on CoE resulted in 65% of the students achieving a sufficient level of quality in their final reports.",

		"abstract": "A revising/replenishment study course in basic mathematics is experienced as being almost a necessity at the beginning of technology studies at the Tampere University of Technology, Pori, Finland. This is to avoid early dropouts in actual engineering mathematics courses. Experimental research on factors explaining successful revision of mathematical topics that employ a specially developed network environment resembling the globally recognized WebCT and the open source software package, Moodle, is reported in this article. In the years 2003 and 2004, a group of Finnish technology university first year students (n = 206) at the Tampere University of Technology, Pori, Finland, participated in a pilot study course in which they first revised basic mathematics employing a network environment and then they took an examination. The results showed a significant improvement in terms of the percentage of successful participants in the test. However, there were two general themes derived from the empirical data that can be seen as potential development targets: (a) impulsive behavior of the students and (b) their weak meta skills.

These activities are intended to be a tool both for students and teachers. On the one hand, they should help the students to acquire a deeper understanding of the mathematical ideas and increase their awareness about the learning progress; on the other hand, they should be useful to the teachers in adjusting their educational strategies by synchronizing them with the students' outcomes. The activities are based on working with coordination of multiple representations of sets in the plane; the motivation for this choice is given by the difficulties encountered by the students in the calculations of double integrals, either in the Calculus courses or in the Mechanics courses. We describe the design and the aims of the activities and analyze the tasks with regard to the mathematical competencies and the feedback given to the students. The tasks have been designed and implemented with GeoGebra and submitted to the students by using a Moodle platform. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Since its creation and evaluation, the tool has been developed and tailored to suit other first year courses based around an academic numeracy framework of competence, confidence and critical awareness (Galligan ). This paper will highlight how the new Self-Test is underpinned by this framework and how students' levels of numeracy can be better understood by the lecturer through Self-Test in a first year nursing for numeracy course and a maths for teachers course. It particularly addresses over- and under-confidence, error analysis and students' reflective comments, and how this understanding can better inform course development and teaching.

		"abstract": "This paper concerns communities of learners and teachers that are formed, develop and interact in university mathematics environments through the theoretical lens of Communities of Practice. From this perspective, learning is described as a process of participation and reification in a community in which individuals belong and form their identity through engagement, imagination and alignment. In addition, when inquiry is considered as a fundamental mode of participation, through critical alignment, the community becomes a Community of Inquiry. We discuss these theoretical underpinnings with examples of their application in research in university mathematics education and, in more detail, in two Research Cases which focus on mathematics students' and teachers' perspectives on proof and on engineering students' conceptual understanding of mathematics. The paper concludes with a critical reflection on the theorising of the role of communities in university level teaching and learning and a consideration of ways forward for future research.

		"abstract": "This study is part of a more extensive research project that addresses the understanding of the derivative concept in university students with prior instruction in differential calculus. In particular, we focus on the analysis of students' responses to a sequence of tasks that require a high level of understanding of the concept, and complement this information with clinical interviews. APOS (Action-Process-Object-Schema) theory and the configuration of the derivative concept that is characterized by: mathematical elements, logical relations and the representation modes that students use to solve a task were used in the analysis of students' responses. The results obtained suggest that thematizing the \"derivative schema\" is difficult to achieve. In addition, nuances were observed in responses given by those students who succeeded, indicating differences in the construction of relations between the successive derivatives of a function.",

		"abstract": "Students' personal interest is hypothesized to be an important resource for learning, but only a few empirical studies have investigated the effect of interest on academic achievement and motivational outcomes of university studies. This lack of empirical studies is remarkable, because inadequate individual prerequisites are considered one reason for study drop-out. High drop-out rates in mathematics studies highlight students' difficulties at the transition from school to university mathematics. The main aim of this contribution is to analyze the impact of cognitive learning prerequisites and mathematics interest on the outcomes in the first semester of a university mathematics program. In line with person--object theories of interest, we differentiate interest facets that reflect the changing nature of mathematics at the transition. We report results of a prediction study with 202 students enrolled in a university mathematics program. Correlation analyses show weak relations between interest and cognitive prerequisites. Regression analyses indicate that interest in proof and formal representations is a strong predictor for study satisfaction and motivation, whereas only cognitive prerequisites show an impact on achievement. Our results indicate how and to what extent the specified instruments measuring individual interests may inform study guidance before and student support during the first semester of a university mathematics program.",

This builds on our previous research into students' conceptions of mathematics. In this paper, we use data from two groups of students studying mathematics: those who participated in an in-depth interview and those who completed an open-ended questionnaire. We found that their responses could be grouped into four categories: don't know; procedural skills; conceptual skills; and professional skills. Although some students held clear ideas about the role of mathematics, many were not able to articulate how it would be used in their future. This has implications for their approach to learning and our approach to teaching.",

		"abstract": "Technology integration in the post-secondary level mathematics classroom has been slow and notoriously difficult. The teacher-as-authority model has long been the standard. Politically motivated influence mandating usage of technology in the classroom has escalated the level of debate in mathematics departments. The result has been a perception of attack resulting in departmental fracture. Causes of faculty resistance are not adequately addressed by typical faculty development sessions. One possible remedy is the introduction of online professional learning communities. Online professional learning communities (OPLC) will allow faculty to investigate and discuss advantages and shortcomings of proposed technology in a less volatile environment. Seeing the success of peers, learning how technology is currently being used, and doing this at a convenient time and location has the potential to lessen distrust and encourage dialogue. An additional benefit to the OPLC model is that it will allow faculty who lack in the competency for successful technology integration the chance to experiment and learn in private while still allowing open communication with peers.

In this paper, I will report on a questionnaire study enquiring about mathematicians' use of CAS in mathematics teaching in three countries; the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hungary. Based on the responses from 1100 mathematicians, I will give an overview of the current extent of CAS use in universities and offer some examples of mathematicians' classroom use of CAS. I will particularly focus on responses from participants who reported employing CAS in their teaching practice. In addition, I attempt to explain the reasons behind these practices and highlight the importance of further research on university-level mathematics education. Accordingly, I will pinpoint possible research directions in this field that could further assist in the successful integration of CAS both by mathematicians and mathematics departments.

		"abstract": "A challenging problem in some developing countries such as Nigeria is inadequate training of students in effective problem solving using the core concepts of their disciplines. Related to this is a disconnection between their learning and socio-economic development agenda of a country. These problems are more vivid in statistical education which is dominated by textbook examples and unbalanced assessment \"for\" and \"of\" learning within traditional curricula. The problems impede the achievement of socio-economic development objectives such as those stated in the Nigerian Vision 2020 blueprint and United Nations Millennium Development Goals. They also impoverish the ability of (statistics) graduates to creatively use their knowledge in relevant business and industry sectors, thereby exacerbating mass graduate unemployment in Nigeria and similar developing countries. This article uses a case study in statistical modelling to discuss the nature of innovations in statistics education vital to producing new kinds of graduates who can link their learning to national economic development goals, create wealth and alleviate poverty through (self) employment. Wider implications of the innovations for repositioning mathematical sciences education globally are explored in this article. (Contains 1 figure.)",

		"abstract": "Although there is no generally accepted list of criteria for the acceptance of proofs in mathematical practice, judging the acceptability of purported proofs is an essential aspect of handling proofs in daily mathematical work. For this reason, school students, university students, and mathematicians need to hold certain acceptance criteria for proofs, which are closely tied to their epistemology, notion of proof, and concept of evidence. However, acceptance criteria have so far received little academic attention and results have often been related to mathematicians' acceptance criteria in a research context. Still, as the role of proof changes during mathematical education and differs from research, it can be assumed that acceptance criteria differ substantially between educational levels and different communities. Thus, we analyzed and compared acceptance criteria by school students, university students, and mathematicians in the context of teaching. The results obtained reveal substantial cross-sectional differences in the frequency and choice of acceptance criteria, as well as major differences from those acceptance criteria reported by prior studies in research contexts. Structure-oriented criteria, regarding the logical structure of a proof or individual inferences, are most often referred to by all groups. In comparison, meaning-oriented criteria, such as understanding, play a minor role. Finally, social criteria were not mentioned in the context of teaching. From an educational perspective, the results obtained underline university students' need for support in implementing acceptance criteria and suggest that a more explicit discussion of the functions of proof, their evidential value, and the criteria for their acceptance may be beneficial.",

		"abstract": "Mathematics teachers play a unique role as experts who provide opportunities for students to engage in the practices of the mathematics community. Proof is a tool essential to the practice of mathematics, and therefore, if teachers are to provide adequate opportunities for students to engage with this tool, they must be able to validate student arguments and provide feedback to students based on those validations. Prior research has demonstrated several weaknesses teachers have with respect to proof validation, but little research has investigated instructional sequences aimed to improve this skill. In this article, we present the results from the implementation of such an instructional sequence. A sample of 34 prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs) validated twelve mathematical arguments written by high school students. They provided a numeric score as well as a short paragraph of written feedback, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of each argument. The results provide insight into the errors to which PSMTs attend when validating mathematical arguments. In particular, PSMTs' written feedback indicated that they were aware of the limitations of inductive argumentation. However, PSMTs had a superficial understanding of the 'proof by contradiction' mode of argumentation, and their attendance to particular errors seemed to be mediated by the mode of argument representation (e.g., symbolic, verbal). We discuss implications of these findings for mathematics teacher education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "In this paper, qualitative results of a case study about the professional knowledge in the area of argumentation and proof of future teachers from universities in three countries are described. Based on results of open questionnaires, data about the competencies these future teachers have in the areas of mathematical knowledge and knowledge of mathematics pedagogy are presented. The study shows that the majority of the future teachers at the participating universities situated in Germany, Hong Kong and Australia, were not able to execute formal proofs, requiring only lower secondary mathematical content, in an adequate and mathematically correct way. In contrast, in all samples there was evidence of at least average competencies of pedagogical content reflection about formal and pre-formal proving in mathematics teaching. However, it appears that possessing a mathematical background as mandated for teaching and having a high affinity with proving in mathematics teaching at the lower secondary level are not a sufficient preparation for teaching proof.

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which a multi-layered women's calculus course influenced the participants' learning of mathematics. This study, conducted in a state university in the Midwestern region of the United States, revealed not only that women in this particular section of calculus were likely to select careers that involved mathematics, but that the focus on peer support, psychosocial issues such as self-confidence, and pedagogy helped the young women overcome gender barriers, as well as barriers of class, poverty, and race. In this article we provide some of the relevant quantitative statistics and relate the stories of two particular women through excerpts from interviews, student artefacts, and participant observation data. We selected these young women because they faced multiple barriers to success in Calculus I and might not have completed the course or taken additional mathematics courses without the support structures that were fundamental to the course.

This approach analyses mediations attached to the use of a given artefact and instruments developed by the subjects from this artefact along instrumental geneses. We draw on three Research Cases at university to illustrate the use of this approach: the first is about students' geneses with a programming technology; the second about students' and teachers' geneses with a virtual learning environment; and the third about textbooks and teachers professional development. We also introduce the documentational approach, which draws on the instrumental approach, but takes into account the broader range of available resources. It distinguishes resources and documents developed by teachers from these resources, and studies teachers' documentation systems. We present a fourth Research Case concerning the documentation system of a mathematics teacher, and focusing on the place of technologies within this system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This case study forms part of a larger research initiative which involved an extensive literature review (Marshall, Jarvis, Lavicza and Buteau, 2012) and a national survey of Canadian Mathematicians (Buteau, Jarvis and Lavicza, 2014). Findings from the case study indicate that sustained implementation at the departmental level requires a unique combination of key factors such as: a dedicated core group led by a committed advocate in a position of influence/power; a strong and shared incentive for change; strategic hiring processes; an administration which supports creative pedagogical reform and well-considered risk-taking; and, a continuous and determined revisiting of the original vision and purpose. Significant challenges to implementation and sustained program development, with specific examples, are also discussed.",

In order to help them develop the teacher stance, we designed a three-phase activity, where two phases took place inside class and the last one occurred outside of class. Novice teachers were given an assignment where they had to rehearse a count in class and enact it in front of a small group of students. They had to write reflections on their rehearsal and enactment. Interviews were done 4 months after the end of the course. The results show that the reflections about mathematics in relation to the use of new teaching practices on eliciting students' thinking allowed the novice teachers to develop the teacher stance.",

		"abstract": "Storytelling is an engaging way through which lived experience can be shared and reflected upon, and a tool through which difference, diversity--and even conflict--can be acknowledged and elaborated upon. Narrative approaches to research bring the richness and vibrancy of storytelling into how data is collected and interpretations of it shared. In this paper, I demonstrate the potency of the narrative approach of \"re-storying\" for a certain type of university mathematics education research (\"non-deficit,\" \"non-prescriptive,\" \"context-specific,\" \"example-centred\" and \"mathematically focused\") conducted at the interface of two communities: mathematics education and mathematics. I do so through reference to \"Amongst Mathematicians\" (Nardi, 2008), a study carried out in collaboration with 20 university mathematicians from six UK mathematics departments. The study deployed re-storying to present data and analyses in the form of a \"dialogue\" between two fictional, yet entirely data-grounded, characters--M, mathematician, and RME, researcher in mathematics education. In the dialogues, the typically conflicting epistemologies--and mutual perceptions of such epistemologies--of the two communities come to the fore as do the feasibility-of, benefits-from, obstacles-in and conditions-for collaboration between these communities. First, I outline the use of narrative approaches in mathematics education research. Then, I introduce the study and its use of re-storying, illustrating this with an example: the construction of a dialogue from interview data in which the participating mathematicians discuss the potentialities and pitfalls of visualisation in university mathematics teaching. I conclude by outlining re-storying as a vehicle for community rapprochement achieved through generating and sharing research findings--the \"substance\" of research--in \"forms\" that reflect the fundamental principles and aims that underpin this research. My conclusions resonate with sociocultural constructs that view mathematics teacher education as contemporary \"praxis\" and the aforementioned inter-community discussion as taking place within a \"third\" space.",

		"abstract": "University students' understanding of photosynthesis was examined in a large introductory biosciences class. The focus of this study was to first examine the conceptions of photosynthesis among students in class and then to investigate how a certain type of text could enhance students' understanding of photosynthesis. The study was based on pre- and post-test designs, in which students' prior knowledge of photosynthesis was measured with ten open-ended questions. The test measured the students' systemic and factual levels of understanding. After students read either a text that systematically pointed out how typical misconceptions contradict scientific concepts (a refutational text) or a traditional text (a non-refutational text), the students' knowledge was tested again with the same test instrument. Results showed that students' prior knowledge and understanding of photosynthesis varied considerably, but both texts seemed to support effective learning. The study revealed several common systemic and factual misconceptions students hold concerning photosynthesis. The knowledge of students majoring in biology was higher than that of non-major students, especially concerning the systemic understanding of photosynthesis. The refutational text appeared to help the students who had weak prior knowledge. Thus, science educators should be aware of the heterogeneity of students concerning their levels of prior knowledge and should design instruction accordingly. We suggest that tools, such as refutational texts, can support students at the university level who have weaker prior understanding.",

		"abstract": "Knowledge is not simply a collection of facts, principles, and formulas; instead, meaningful knowledge is organized around core concepts that guide peoples' thinking about a subject. Therefore, knowledge organization is recognized as an important component of understanding learning and teaching. In this research, knowledge organization of two physics university textbooks was compared with that of four physics university teachers. The topic studied was magnetostatics with an emphasis on two topics of Biot-Savart law and Ampère's law. The aim of study was to examine the structural features of the subject matter knowledge of teachers and textbooks. For this reason, concept maps were utilized to picture clearly their knowledge organizations. Concept maps were evaluated by means of a focus on their structural characteristics including hierarchy and clustering. Results indicate that the hierarchical organizations between knowledge of teachers and textbooks vary from one topic to another. The hierarchical organizations of teachers are more comparable to textbooks for the topic of Biot-Savart law. The clustering behaves in a very similar way in the case of patterns between textbooks and teachers for both topics. It was observed that the knowledge arrangements of Ampère's law were more hierarchical, while the knowledge organizations of Biot-Savart were more clustered. Moreover, structural properties varied from one topic to another, even though topics belong to the same context. The possibility of recognizing such difference in knowledge organization is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents findings from a case study on the impact of high stakes oral performance assessment on third year mathematics students' approaches to learning (Entwistle and Ramsden, Understanding student learning, 1983). We choose oral performance assessment as this mode of assessment differs substantially from written exams for its dialogic nature and because variation of assessment methods is seen to be very important in an otherwise very uniform assessment diet. We found that students perceived the assessment to require conceptual understanding over memory and were more likely to employ revision strategies conducive to deep learning (akin to conceptual understanding) when preparing for the oral performance assessment than when preparing for a written exam. Moreover, they reported to have engaged and interacted in lectures more than they would have otherwise, another characteristic conducive to deep learning approaches. We conclude by suggesting some implications for the summative assessment of mathematics at university level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "We examined the development of interest in first-year university students in a lower secondary school teachers' program as well as connections between learners' belief systems and interest. Students' mathematics-related belief systems include their personal understanding of the nature of mathematics as a scientific domain (in the present study: aspects of process, application, schema, and formalism). Data (N = 92) on beliefs and mathematical interest were collected at the beginning of the first (T1) and second terms (T3). In addition, students' interest was assessed at the ends of both terms (T2 and T4). Results showed that (1) students' interest in mathematics remained stable during the first academic year, (2) application beliefs showed positive correlations with interest in the first but not the second term, and (3) application beliefs at the beginning of the term predicted students' interest at the end of term in the second but not the first term; moreover, process, schema, and formalism beliefs did not predict interest in the first or in the second term. We discuss these results with respect to the influence of belief systems on interest but also with respect to possible effects that are based on differences between school mathematics and university mathematics.",

Nine teachers in grades 1 to 6, in collaboration with two researchers, were using content representation (CoRe) in learning study (LS)-inspired cycle as pedagogical tools when planning, implementing, and reflecting on lessons and pupil learning. By using pre- and post-tests, the teachers acquired knowledge about pupil subject-specific knowledge and learning.

		"abstract": "Lectures have been widely criticized as a method of teaching, but remain a standard component of most university mathematics courses. Does this necessarily harm students' education? This critical review contends that many arguments against lecturing are misconceived, at least when applied to mathematics. The effectiveness of lectures in carrying out various functions is discussed with reference to some recent educational research. There is evidence that lectures can be effective in communicating information, modelling reasoning and motivating students. Therefore, when supported appropriately by other activities, lectures provide an effective component of a mathematical education. (Contains 1 figure and 5 notes.)",

		"abstract": "Certain mathematical concepts were not introduced to solve a specific open problem but rather to solve different problems with the same tools in an economic formal way or to unify several approaches: such concepts, as some of those of linear algebra, are presumably difficult to introduce to students as they are potentially interwoven with many types of difficulties as formal ones and far away from the actual knowledge of the students. The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology for studying the introduction of such concepts in linear algebra during tutorial sessions at the beginning of university, the wording of the concepts being yet presented during lectures. For this purpose, we amend a general methodology of Pariès, Robert and Rogalski inside the general framework of Activity Theory. This methodology lets us take into account several specificities of these concepts and studies the mathematical activity the teacher organises for students and the way he manages the relationship between students' actual activities and mathematical tasks. We also present an implementation of this methodology based on a French university course to illustrate our approach and discuss its possibilities.",

		"abstract": "Constructivism was introduced to Vietnam through many ways such as workshops, books, the Internet, and so on. However, due to the lack of professional education, fundamental ideas of constructivist learning perhaps were missing or neglected through classroom activities. Furthermore, due to the influence of culture and society, Vietnamese constructivism certainly has its own agenda. This paper adapted the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES) which was originally developed by Taylor and Fraser (1991) to investigate the classroom environment in a Physics Teacher Education programme in Vietnam, as well as to illustrate Vietnamese teacher educators' views in employing constructivist learning. Fifteen teaching periods in seven different classrooms were observed, and five teacher educators from those classes were interviewed. Participants are lecturers and bachelor students of the Physics Teacher Education programme at Can Tho University, Mekong Delta region, south of Vietnam. Results showed that all five scales of the CLES in these classrooms are at the intermediate level. All the lecturers indicated positive attitudes about constructivism and have certain methods to perform these constructivist issues in their classes, but they have problems in practical instructional strategies for some scales. Therefore, we suggest that professional development programmes on how to apply constructivist theory, based on each particular scale of the CLES, are essential. This is especially true in scientific uncertainty, critical voice, and shared control. Yet, in a country that highly appreciates Confucianism with social order, not all aspects of an ideal constructivist learning environment should be equally improved. Generally, we believe that constructivist learning will be a key answer to the problem of the generally passive learning style in Vietnam.",

We use as our time period from publication in the United States of the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for Schools Mathematics through 2016. A search of a combination of electronic databases and targeted international journals resulted in a total of 11 studies that looked at some aspect of affect with EPTs in all or some part of a university mathematics course over the 27-year time period. Nine of the 11 studies occurred in the context of a course or courses categorized as involving an alternative pedagogy that was student-centered. Overall we found that a student-centered approach to instruction supported changes in EPTs' affect that align with pedagogical recommendations in reform documents such as the NCTM Standards. However, shifts were sometimes difficult to come by and encountered resistance from EPTs. Implications for course learning experiences are offered and conflicting results between studies suggest directions for future research.",

		"abstract": "This paper addresses a topic within university mathematics education which has been somewhat underexplored: the teaching practices actually used by university mathematics teachers when giving lectures. The study investigates the teaching practices of seven Swedish university teachers on the topic of functions using a discursive approach, the commognitive framework of Sfard. In the paper a categorization of the construction and substantiation routines used by the teachers is presented, for instance various routines for constructing definitions and examples, and for verifying whether an example satisfies a given definition. The findings show that although the overall form of the lectures is similar, with teachers using \"chalk talk,\" and overt student participation limited to asking and answering questions, there are in fact significant differences in the way the teachers present and do mathematics in their lectures. These differences present themselves both on the level of discursive routines and on a more general level in how the process of doing mathematics is made visible in the teachers' teaching practices. Moreover, I believe that many of the results of the study could be relevant for investigating the teaching of other mathematical topics.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we outline the main tenets of the commognitive approach and we exemplify its application in studies that investigate the learning and teaching of mathematics at university level. Following an overview of such applications, we focus on three studies that explore fundamental discursive shifts often occurring in the early stages of studying Calculus. These shifts concern the lecturers' and students' communicative practices, routines of constructing mathematical objects and ways of resolving commognitive conflicts. We then propose that commognitive constructs such as subjectification can be deployed towards ‘scaling-up’ the hitherto fine-grained focus of commognitive analyses. Finally, we conclude with observing how the commognitive approach relates to constructs from other sociocultural approaches to research in university mathematics education, such as “legitimate peripheral participation” from the theory of Communities of Practice and “didactic contract” from the Theory of Didactic Situations.

		"abstract": "This paper investigates the teaching practices used by university mathematics teachers when lecturing, a topic within university mathematics education research which is gaining an increasing interest. In the study, a view of mathematics teaching as a discursive practice is taken, and Sfard's commognitive framework is used to investigate the teaching practices of seven Swedish university mathematics teachers on the topic of functions. The present paper looks at the discourse of mathematics teaching, presenting a categorization of the didactical routines into three categories-- \"explanation,\" \"motivation\" and \"question posing\" routines. All of these are present in the discourses of all seven teachers, but within these general categories, a number of different sub-categories of routines are found, used in different ways and to different extent by the various teachers. The explanation routines include \"known mathematical facts,\" \"summary and repetition,\" \"different representations,\" \"everyday language,\" and \"concretization and metaphor\"; the motivation routines include reference to \"utility,\" \"the nature of mathematics,\" \"humour\" and \"result focus\"; and the question posing routines include \"control questions,\" asking for \"facts,\" \"enquiries\" and \"rhetorical questions.\" This categorization of question posing routines, for instance, complements those already found in the literature. In addition to providing a valuable insight into the teaching of functions at the university level, the categorizations presented in the study can also be useful for investigating the teaching of other mathematical topics.",

Whereas previous research indicates that students do not appreciate the importance of lecturers' non-written comments and record in their notes only what is written on the board when taught with the traditional chalk and talk method, some students in our study recorded the non-written comments as well as some of their own links between sections of the lecture. We did not, however, find students' attitude towards those comments to be different from what previous research found. We conclude that guided notes can be an appropriate way of teaching university mathematics but on their own cannot make the pedagogical intentions of the lecturer clearer to the students. We also found that the educational environment plays a big part for all aspects of student learning, including decisions related to note-taking during lectures.",

The goal of this article is to discuss what this insight is from mathematicians' perspective. Based on interviews with nine research-active mathematicians, two sources of insight are discussed. The first is reading a proof to develop new representations for mathematical concepts. The second is identifying reasoning techniques that might be useful in mathematicians' own area of research. The mathematicians further contended that they have these goals when presenting proofs in the undergraduate mathematics courses that they teach.",

In order to meet the individual instructional needs of the students, virtual science laboratories should be researched to accomplish the goal. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a virtual chemistry laboratory in enhancing students' conceptual understanding as a pre-laboratory assignment. The study included thirteen undergraduate science majors enrolled in a second semester general chemistry laboratory course. Two experiments were selected from the syllabus to be performed virtually, in addition to the physical laboratory. The Chemistry Assessment Test in Kinetics (CATK) was developed and administered as a pre- and post-assessment tool to determine if conceptual understanding had taken place. The difference in results of the paired samples t-test was significant from the pre- and post-CATK which indicated that the students' conceptual understanding increased after completing the virtual chemistry laboratory. The results also determined that the male students outperformed their female counterparts on the CATK.",

		"abstract": "According to the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2009) learning with multimedia requires the integration of verbal and visual information (e.g., printed text and static images, narrated animation). Studies exploring the effects of dynamic versus static presentations yield mixed results. Few studies explore comparing dynamic versus static presentations to teach mathematics. Most experimental studies occur in a controlled lab setting. The present study aimed to assess the impact of multimedia learning formats beyond the experimental lab to an authentic setting (i.e., classrooms) to teach mathematics. In Spring 2017, we compared weekly outcomes for students who accessed online interactive video modules (DYNAMIC) demonstrating calculus level 1 topics to students who accessed the same content presented in printed text and static image format (STATIC). Students in two sections of undergraduate course Calculus 1 (011) and (001) alternated each week the online pre-work material presented in either interactive video module or text-image document. They were assessed with problem-solving and conceptual questions at the beginning and end of each week. The results demonstrated no statistically significant differences on presentation formats for the assessments provided at the beginning and end of each week. Participants also answered the same survey question at the end of each online topical lesson related to the perceived effectiveness of the instructional material to help students master the topic. Survey results indicate students perceived the weekly instructional content, presented in a static or dynamic format, to be equally helpful to prepare them to master the material.",

		"abstract": "In the past decade, there has been an increased emphasis on the preparation of teachers who can effectively engage students in meaningful mathematics with technology tools. This study presents a closer look at how three prospective teachers interpreted and developed in their role of facilitating students’ mathematical problem solving with a technology tool. A cycle of planning–experience–reflection was repeated twice during an undergraduate course to allow the prospective teachers to change their strategies when working with two different groups of students. Case study methods were used to identify and analyze critical events that occurred throughout the different phases of the study and how these events may have influenced the prospective teachers’ work with students. Looking across the cases, several themes emerged. The prospective teachers (1) used their problem solving approaches to influence their pedagogical decisions; (2) desired to ask questions that would guide students in their solution strategies; (3) recognized their own struggle in facilitating students’ problem solving and focused on improving their interactions with students; (4) assumed the role of an explainer for some portion of their work with students; (5) used technological representations to promote students’ mathematical thinking or focus their attention; and (6) used the technology tools in ways consistent with the nature of their interactions and perceived role with students. The implications inform the development of an expanded learning trajectory for what we might expect as prospective teachers develop an understanding of how to teach mathematics in technology-rich environments.

WebQuest, the name given to an inquiry-oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by learners is drawn from the Web, is being suggested as a means of enhancing learning. This paper investigates how WebQuests might be effective in developing the problem-posing skills of pre-service mathematics teachers. Fifty pre-service teachers from a College of Education took part in this research and, with data from both an achievement test in mathematics problem-posing and a mathematics problem-posing beliefs scale, the effectiveness of using WebQuests in learning problem-posing was measured. The results show significant differences between those preservice teachers who experienced WebQuests and those who did not; illustrating that it is possible to change the beliefs of pre-service teachers toward the role of problem-posing in mathematics education [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Algebra is the fundamental language of mathematics, and a profound understanding of school algebra is an important prerequisite for further studies in mathematical sciences. The aim of this study is to characterize the algebraic competence of the Norwegian upper secondary school students participating in Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced. Based on theoretical conceptualizations of school algebra (Kieran, 2004) and of mathematical competence (Niss & Højgaard, 2011), a set of item descriptors have here been developed. Each of the algebra items in the TIMSS Advanced mathematics test have then been evaluated with respect to these descriptors, and correlations between student performance and item descriptors have been calculated. The results show that Norwegian upper secondary school students tend to perform weakly on items that place high demands on symbol manipulation. Furthermore, these students' strength is in tasks that are placed in an extra-mathematical (applied) context, that require text comprehension, where students are expected to generate the mathematical expressions needed to find a solution, but that place low demands on student ability to manipulate symbolic expressions. Hence, the results of this study suggests that if Norwegian upper secondary school students' mastery of algebra is to be promoted, it seems reasonable to devote more teaching resources to the transformational aspects of algebraic activity, i.e. to developing their ability to efficiently manipulate symbolic expressions.",

We study this in the context of functions because understanding them permeates secondary and advanced mathematics.

A small observational study of two mathematically well-qualified teachers, teaching at a range of levels, leads to a deeper understanding of how their personal mathematical knowledge is manifested in their teaching. Finally, we present a theory of pedagogy combining dual development, intellectual necessity, and repeated experience of reasoning, for which these teachers' practices provide illustrations.",

In this paper, we explore and describe the structure of Spanish primary mathematics teacher education programs. We analyzed the documents collected from the 48 sampled Spanish institutions that participated in TEDS-M. Our approach to the syllabus analysis focused on the established content dimension of curriculum in educators' syllabi. These contents are structured into 4 knowledge domains--school mathematics, advanced mathematics, general pedagogy, and mathematics pedagogy--and categorized into subjects and topics. The results show that Spanish teacher education programs are diverse across institutions, but follow a basic structure that emphasizes the teaching of general pedagogy subjects.",

Data sources for this study included position papers and written notes from a group interview of 15 Israeli teachers who studied in a special master's program, of which advanced mathematics courses comprise a sizeable share. Data analysis was iterative and comparative, aiming at identifying and characterizing teachers' different perspectives. Overall, all participating teachers thought that the advanced mathematics studies in the program were relevant to their teaching of secondary school mathematics. Moreover, teachers specifically mentioned the importance of studying contemporary mathematics from research mathematicians. All teachers pointed out at least one specific feature that they viewed as relevant to their work: advanced mathematics courses (1) as a resource for teaching secondary school mathematics, (2) for improving understanding about what mathematics is, and (3) for reminding teachers what learning mathematics feels like.",

		"abstract": "In advanced mathematical thinking, proving and refuting are crucial abilities to demonstrate whether and why a proposition is true or false. Learning proofs and counterexamples within the domain of continuous functions is important because students encounter continuous functions in many mathematics courses. Recently, a growing number of studies have provided evidence that students have difficulty with mathematical proofs. Few of these research studies, however, have focused on undergraduates' abilities to produce proofs and counterexamples in the domain of continuous functions. The goal of this study is to contribute to research on student productions of proofs and counterexamples and to identify their abilities and mathematical understandings. The findings suggest more attention should be paid to teaching and learning proofs and counterexamples, as participants showed difficulty in writing these statements. More importantly, the analysis provides insight into the design of curriculum and instruction that may improve undergraduates' learning in advanced mathematics courses.",

In addition, sex differences in achievement, interest, and course selection were analyzed. At the end of Grade 10, students opted for either a basic or an advanced mathematics course. Data analyses revealed sex differences in favor of boys in mathematics achievement, interest, and opting for an advanced mathematics course. Further analyses by means of structural equation modeling show that interest had no significant effect on learning from Grade 7 to Grade 10, but did affect course selection—that is, highly interested students were more likely to choose an advanced course. Furthermore, interest at the end of Grade 10 had a direct and an indirect effect (via course selection) on achievement in upper secondary school. In addition, results suggest that, at least from Grade 7 to Grade 10, achievement affected interest—that is, high achievers expressed more interest than low achievers. The findings underline the importance of interest for academic choices and for self-regulated learning when the instructional setting is less structured. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",

		"abstract": "Many Australian students from poor families decline to take advanced mathematics when they reach senior secondary school, resulting in an under-representation of disadvantaged student groups in the advanced mathematics streams. It is important to promote disadvantaged students’ aspirations for advanced mathematics given the significance of this important subject for future academic and career opportunities. The current study followed a selected group of achieving mathematics students from low SES families (n = 30) for 3 years to understand what motivates them to learn mathematics and whether they aspire for advanced mathematics. Data collection activities spanned over 3 years beginning when the participating students were in year 8. The dataset includes student interviews in year 8 and year 9, students’ survey responses in year 9, teachers’ assessment of students’ likelihood to take advanced mathematics, students’ reported aspirations for advanced mathematics in year 8 and year 9, and their subject choice decisions in year 10. The findings showed that these students, notwithstanding economic disadvantage, were motivated to learn mathematics. Many aspired for advanced mathematics and held multiple reasons for learning mathematics. In contrast, those who did not intend to take advanced mathematics in senior secondary school learnt predominantly with performance considerations. The results are discussed in light of supporting students’ mathematics aspirations from a motivational perspective. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "In Australia, many Year 10 students choose not to enrol in Year 11 and 12 intermediate and advanced mathematics courses, despite having the ability to complete these courses successfully. Girls, in particular, remain significantly underrepresented in such courses. In this study, Year 10 students identified by their teachers as capable of succeeding in an advanced Year 11 mathematics course attended one of eight focus group sessions. In these sessions, they discussed the factors they considered in choosing their Year 11 mathematics courses. The data were analysed through a combination of directed and conventional content analysis, to capture both established importance factors in mathematics course choice, and potentially new or context-specific factors that arose within this group. Intrinsic value, utility value, generalized mathematics self-efficacy and sociocultural influences were cited most frequently as important factors in students’ decision-making. Findings not only affirmed the relevance of expectancy-value theory for describing the motivational factors that influence students’ mathematics course choices, but also underscored the need to consider the sociocultural contexts within which these choice decisions are made. © 2019, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",

The students in this study were studying advanced mathematics (wiskunde D) at upper secondary school in the Netherlands. These students are often not aware of the relevance of the mathematics they have to learn in school. More insights into the application of mathematics in other sciences can be beneficial for these students in terms of preparation for their future study and career. A course differentiating by student interest with new context-rich curriculum materials was developed in order to enhance students’ beliefs about the relevance of mathematics. The intervention aimed at teaching differential equations through guided small-group tasks in scientific, medical or economical contexts.

		"abstract": "A critical issue related to the use of simulation environments in school-based learning is the relationship between the use of these environments and the structure of traditional curricula. Teachers are often caught in the bind of attempting to address significantly raised standards for what all students should know, yet receiving very little support to innovate in their use of simulations in their approaches to teaching. Particularly challenging for practitioners and school-based researchers alike is the expectation that students should first master \"the basics\" before engaging innovation related to learning advanced content such as calculus. This paper summarizes years of work related to the early learning of the mathematics of change. The goal is to resolve this tension by suggesting that advanced mathematics, embodied in an accessible simulation environment, helps situate and deepen students' understanding of the basics as they typically are encountered in the traditional mathematics curriculum. Selected episodes transcribed from work in economically challenged schools in the United States are used to illustrate the practical potential of this reconsideration of the relationships between basic and advanced topics. The delta-blocks approach to the mathematics of change, making use of widely available forms of technology and the \"MathWorlds\" simulation software, is introduced and illustrated.

Thus far, the literature has highlighted the benefits of applying the conclusions of particular proofs to secondary content and of developing a more general sense of disciplinary practices in mathematics in relation to proof. Instead, we consider implications for secondary teachers that stem from the study of content within particular proofs in advanced mathematics. Illustrating with one example, we explore another way in which the study of advanced mathematics might be used to serve prospective secondary teachers.",

		"abstract": "Students often play a passive role in large-scale lectures in undergraduate mathematics courses: they observe the lecturer demonstrate mathematical procedures, but they rarely engage in authentic mathematical activity themselves. This study uses semi-structured interviews of undergraduate students to investigate the implicit and explicit social norms and expectations that influence students to maintain their passive roles during lectures. Students were aware that their passivity was influenced by social norms, but perceived these norms as necessary for allowing the lecturer to get through the content in the allotted lecture time, while enabling students to avoid being publicly embarrassed in the lecture. However, the students appreciated opportunities to work on examples in small groups during lectures. We argue that the success of small group interactions during large-scale lectures depends on students and lecturers establishing supportive social norms, and adjusting their lecture goals from ‘covering the content’ to ‘developing mathematical understanding’. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "School leaders employ various school-based actions to influence students’ subject enrolments at senior secondary levels (Years 11 and 12), which in turn affect students’ entrance into tertiary courses and career choices. In the context of reported declines in the proportion of students opting to study higher-level mathematics, this qualitative study sought insights into seven Australian mathematics teacher leaders’ decision-making processes and actions in their particular school contexts. It aimed to relate their actions to particular attributions for enrolment declines and their goals for students’ learning and achievement. The leaders’ attributions included students’ lack of ability, changes in university courses’ pre-requisites, students’ lack of effort or persistence, and negative attitudes towards mathematics. The leaders described a variety of school-based actions; some school leaders had actually chosen opposing actions but expressed similar reasons for implementing them, and vice versa. Tensions among external pragmatic constraints, the actions of other school staff, and the teacher leaders’ own goals for student learning in mathematics framed the findings of this study. © 2019, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",

However, there are relatively few empirical studies on what takes place during this instruction, why this instruction is used, and how it affects students' learning. In this paper, I investigate these issues by examining a case study of one professor using this type of instruction in an introductory real analysis course. I first describe the professor's actions in the classroom and argue that these actions are the result of the professor's beliefs about mathematics, students, and education, as well as his knowledge of the material being covered. I then illustrate how the professor's teaching style influenced the way that his students attempted to learn the material. Finally, I discuss the implications that the reported data have on mathematics education research. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

We leveraged a theoretically motivated instructional model to design modules for a real analysis course that could inform secondary teachers’ pedagogy, focusing on how this model was implemented in a single module about “attending to scope.” The central aim is to document how teachers’ experience in this real analysis course influenced their subsequent teaching. In the majority of lessons we observed from six participating teachers, the following occurred: (i) the teacher explicitly attended to the scope of statements discussed in class; and (ii) in post-class interviews, the teacher highlighted their deliberate attention to scope and attributed this behavior to their experience in the experimental real analysis course. We discuss the design approach, its relation to teachers’ actions in the classroom, and potential implications for teacher education in advanced content courses. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

The analysis also indicates the undesirable issues that are at the root of impeding success in the calculus module. Most important is that students are not encouraged to become independent thinkers from an early age. This triggers problems in follow-up courses where students are expected to have learned to deal with the work load and understanding of certain concepts.

		"abstract": "The aim of this research is to analyse students' sense-making regarding matrix representation of geometric transformations in a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) within the perspective of semiotic mediation. In particular, the focus is on students' reasoning on the transition from the notion of function to transformation and to matrix representation of geometric transformations in R 2 . Along these lines, the theory of semiotic mediation is referred to as a theoretical framework in both the design of a teaching and learning environment and the emergence of mathematical thinking. Epistemological analysis was employed to elaborate the semiotic potential of the DGE and, thereafter, two specific tasks were considered. Task-based interviews were conducted with a pair of undergraduate linear algebra students, with the students working in front of a computer installed with a specific DGE: GeoGebra. The data sources are video-recorded interviews, screen recorder software, field notes and the students' production analysed through a semiotic lens. According to the results, the dragging tool evokes a sense of understanding of covariation and independent/dependent variables. In addition, the simultaneous use of the dragging tool and grid function evokes a sense of the geometric transformation and the notion of matrix representation of geometric transformations, while the ApplyMatrix construction command plays a key role in linking the notions of function, transformation and matrix transformation.

		"abstract": "Deficiencies in beginning undergraduate students’ basic mathematical skills has been an issue of concern in higher education, particularly in the past 15 years. This issue has been tracked and analysed in a number of universities in Ireland and internationally through student scores recorded in mathematics diagnostic tests. Students beginning their science-based and technology-based undergraduate courses in the University of Limerick have had their basic mathematics skills tested without any prior warning through a 40 question diagnostic test during their initial service mathematics lecture since 1998. Data gathered through this diagnostic test have been recorded in a database kept at the university and explored to track trends in mathematical competency of these beginning undergraduates. This paper details findings surrounding an analysis of the database between 2003 and 2013, outlining changes in mathematical competencies of these beginning undergraduates in an attempt to determine reasons for such changes. The analysis found that the proportion of students tested through this diagnostic test that are predicted to be at risk of failing their service mathematics end-of-semester examinations has increased significantly between 2003 and 2013. Furthermore, when students' performance in secondary level mathematics was controlled, it was determined that the performance of beginning undergraduates in 2013 was statistically significantly below that of the performance of the beginning undergraduates recorded 10 years previously. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

		"abstract": "Policy decisions and their implementation impact on the teaching and learning of mathematics in many ways. Sometimes this is overt and takes account of local factors and professional opinion. However global economic policies, often dominated by the actions of huge multinational corporations, can have considerable influence on all aspects of education including mathematics education. These policies appear to be creating greater inequity between and within nations. Quality mathematics education for all, a recurring theme at International Congress on Mathematical Education meetings, is becoming less of a reality. At the same time, mathematics education at every level is increasingly influenced by powerful bureaucrats rather than by the profession. It is suggested that mathematical scientists need to try to understand the political forces affecting mathematics education for the ICMI study on teaching and learning mathematics at the tertiary level to have maximum impact. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "In theory, practical work is an established part of university-level chemistry courses. However, mainly due to budget constraints, large class size, time constraints and inadequate teacher preparations, practical activities are frequently left out from chemistry classroom instruction in most developing countries. Small-scale chemistry (SSC) experimentation in which one uses miniature chemical equipment can drastically reduce quantities of chemicals used during experimentation, which can help overcome some of the barriers preventing practical work in the chemistry classroom. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using miniature chemical equipment at the undergraduate level in increasing students’ understanding of chemistry concepts as well as in improving their attitude towards chemistry practical work. Two comparable groups of first-year students who enrolled for a Practical General Chemistry course participated. A quasi-experimental design was employed in which the experimental group (N = 49) used the SSC approach while the control group (N = 52) followed the traditional approach for over 8 weeks. Data were gathered using chemistry tests, attitude and perception questionnaires and interviews. Findings showed that the SSC approach was as effective as the traditional laboratory approach in improving students’ attitude towards practical work, but more effective in enhancing students’ understanding of chemistry concepts. More interestingly, SSC was positively accepted by both students and instructors as an effective strategy for teaching first-year undergraduate chemistry practicals. Some shortcomings of the approach were also identified. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.",

		"abstract": "This theoretical paper presents a methodology for instructional design in mathematics. It is a theoretical analysis of a proposed model for instructional design, where tasks are embedded in situations that preserve meaning with respect to particular pieces of mathematical knowledge. The model is applicable when there is an intention of teaching someone some particular mathematical knowledge. It is structured into four phases: epistemological analysis; development of an epistemological model; implementation; and, institutionalisation. The methodology is rooted in the theory of didactical situations in mathematics, and is built on two epistemological principles: the target knowledge should be an optimal solution to a task embedded in a situation; and, the milieu of the situation should provide feedback to students, whether their responses are adequate with respect to the target knowledge. These principles place the generic and epistemic student at the centre of instructional design in such a way that the focal point is on the student’s opportunities to develop the knowledge aimed at—from an epistemological viewpoint. My research goal is to develop a model for instructional design where students will need some particular knowledge to solve a task and where the solution process is managed by features of the milieu with which the students interact. Through the concept of an epistemological model, the methodology enables a profound understanding of one of the phases of didactical engineering: conception and a priori analysis. Empirical data are provided to support the viability of the proposed model. The data are from an empirical investigation of student teachers’ engagement with a situation where the target knowledge is a theorem in elementary number theory. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.",

		"abstract": "Mathematics education researchers have investigated mathematics anxiety in prospective elementary teachers. While many of these studies have focused on the bodily sensations and emotions of mathematics anxiety, particularly those felt in assessment situations, opportunities remain to investigate how prospective elementary teachers interpret their experiences with mathematics anxiety and connect them over time to compose personal histories of mathematics anxiety. Currently, over 90 % of elementary teachers in US schools are women, and women have been shown to suffer more from mathematics anxiety than do men. In this article, I analyze how one woman prospective elementary teacher described, explained, and related her experiences of mathematics anxiety across her personal narratives of learning mathematics as a K-12 student and of learning to teach mathematics as a college student in a teacher preparation program. My research demonstrates that experiences of mathematics anxiety may persist beyond assessment situations to influence women prospective elementary teachers’ larger mathematical histories. I also show that women prospective elementary teachers may interpret mathematics anxiety as specific fears (e.g., loss of opportunities for social participation) and may develop particular coping strategies related to those fears. Finally, I point out that while a coping strategy may be used consistently across K-12 mathematics learning and undergraduate teacher preparation, and may even offer a woman prospective elementary teacher some relief from mathematics anxiety, it may also limit her mathematics learning and professional development. To conclude, I present implications of my research for mathematics teacher educators. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

		"abstract": "In light of recent reform recommendations, teachers are expected to turn proofs and proving into an ongoing component of their classroom practice. Two questions emerging from this requirement are: Is the mathematical knowledge of high school teachers sufficient to prove various kinds of statements? Does teachers' knowledge allow them to determine the validity of an argument made by their students? The results of this study, in which 50 secondary school teachers participated, point to a positive answer to the first question in the framework of elementary number theory (ENT). However, the picture is more complex with respect to the second one. Results indicated that some teachers may over-value the generality of symbolic mode of representation and under-value the generality of verbal ones. Possibly, the verbal representation of an argument is less transparent and more difficult to understand. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

This evaluation revealed that teachers had moved away from transmission-based orientations, encouraged by the use of less structured tasks and sample lesson plans, but some found it difficult to adopt IBL pedagogies.

		"abstract": "Although counting problems are easy to state and provide rich, accessible problem-solving situations, there is much evidence that students struggle with solving counting problems correctly. With combinatorics (and the study of counting problems) becoming increasingly prevalent in K–12 and undergraduate curricula, there is a need for researchers to identify potentially significant factors that might have an effect on student success as they solve counting problems. We tested one such factor among undergraduate students—their systematic listing of what they were trying to count. We argue that even creating partial lists of the set of outcomes led to significant improvements in performance in students’ success on problems, implying that systematic listing may be worthwhile for students to engage in as they learn to count. Our findings suggest that more needs to be done to refine instructional interventions that facilitate listing.

		"abstract": "This paper presents the findings from a survey used to investigate how mathematicians perceive the genre of mathematical proof writing at the undergraduate level. Mathematicians were asked whether various proof excerpts highlighted in four partial proofs were unconventional in each one of three pedagogical contexts: undergraduate mathematics textbooks, what instructors write on the blackboard in undergraduate mathematics courses, and how students write mathematics in these courses. There are four main findings. First, there are some potential breaches of mathematical language that participants found unconventional regardless of the context in which they occur. Second, there are some differences in how mathematicians perceived the linguistic conventions in blackboard proofs and student-produced proofs. Third, textbook authors are expected to adhere to stricter writing norms than mathematics instructors and undergraduate students when writing proofs. Fourth, there were some potential breaches of mathematical language that the literature suggests were unconventional, which were not evaluated as unconventional by the mathematicians. We argue that this diversity of expectations regarding the language of mathematical proof writing in undergraduate classrooms, together with the potential disconnect between those expectations and the types of proofs that students see presented in those classrooms, could make it difficult for students to become proficient in this important mathematical discourse. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",

Through observations of lectures and discussions with firstyear mathematics undergraduates in an English university, we identified and analysed the messages that two of their lecturers transmitted to them during this transitional phase. The results suggest that strongly framed messages are more easily perceived by students and affect them during their transition. Additionally, messages that have been received in the school context continue to have control over students’ thinking and on many occasions can impede adjustment to the new setting. © The Author(s) 2017.",

		"abstract": "The new math was a several-decade-long movement to update school mathematics that began in the mid twentieth century in many countries around the world. It took many forms, but much of it involved the preparation of new instructional materials, including textbooks. Much of the new math activity in Europe and North America was stimulated by conferences and seminars of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the early 1960s. Although the initial reform efforts addressed secondary school mathematics courses that prepared pupils for tertiary education, those efforts quickly spread to primary school mathematics, to pupils not headed to tertiary education, and to non-OECD countries. Mathematicians and schoolteachers were divided about the direction that the new math reforms took. Although the new math is often deemed a failed endeavor, it changed not only school mathematics but also the way people and countries viewed school mathematics. © 2012 FIZ Karlsruhe.",

The main objective of the Initiative is to enable undergraduates to better learn calculus and the critical thinking skills necessary to apply it in a variety of science and engineering problems. Changes in content and pedagogy are emphasized, including instructional teamwork and student-centred learning, involving students working cooperatively in small groups and exploring mathematical ideas using appropriate technologies. Achievement and retention of Initiative students are compared with a control group from the standard calculus sequence. Student attitudes about the usefulness of the Initiative's curriculum, pedagogy, and its influence on learning are discussed. Future implications including new uses of distributed learning are also addressed. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

		"abstract": "Many studies provide insights into students’ conceptions of various linear algebra topics and difficulties they face with multiple modes of thinking needed for conceptualization. While it is important to understand students’ initial conceptions, students’ transfer of learning of these conceptions to subsequent courses can provide additional information to structure meaningful curricular materials. This study explores physics students’ transfer of learning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors from prerequisite experiences to quantum mechanics. Data analysis focused on three task-based interviews with undergraduate students, observations of physics courses, and students’ course artifacts. Existing studies on students’ conceptions of linear algebra topics indicate the necessity of developing flexible shifts between different modes of thinking in order to grasp linear algebra. This study’s participants, who had initial learning experiences of linear algebra, were also observed to struggle with such shifts prior to quantum courses. It seems that various contexts in quantum courses, and explicit instructional methods, provided opportunities for students to enhance this initial learning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, the explicit reasoning of one of the quantum courses’ instructors concerning the choice of certain representations during problem solving in class, seemed to facilitate students’ construction of similarities, thus providing evidence for actor-oriented transfer. Results of this study align with goals for recently developed instructional materials and interventions that emphasize opportunities for students to inquire and connect multiple modes of thinking. © 2019, FIZ Karlsruhe.",

Analysis explored elements of ‘sensitivity to students’ and ‘mathematical challenge’ in the observed teaching. Initial analyses suggested teaching to consist mainly of tutor exposition and closed questions embodying little challenge for the student. More finely grained analyses provided insights into pedagogic processes relating teaching actions, processes and strategies and their learning outcomes, and providing alternative perspectives on sensitivity and challenge. The research, distinctively, shows approaches to analyzing teaching that start to address tutor-student interactions related to cognitive construction of mathematics (here abstract algebra) by undergraduates within the social dimensions of the tutorial setting.

		"abstract": "Different forms of curriculum determine what is taught and learned in US classrooms and have been used to stimulate school improvement and to hold school systems accountable for progress. For example, the intended curriculum reflected in standards or learning expectations increasingly influences how instructional time is spent in classrooms. Curriculum materials such as textbooks, instructional units, and computer software constitute the textbook curriculum, which continues to play a dominant role in teachers' instructional decisions. These decisions influence the actual implemented curriculum in classrooms. Various curriculum policies, including mandated end-ofcourse assessments (the assessed curriculum) and requirements for all students to complete particular courses (e.g., year-long courses in algebra, geometry, and advanced algebra or equivalent integrated mathematics courses) are also being implemented in increasing numbers of states. The wide variation across states in their intended curriculum documents and requirements has led to a historic and precedent-setting effort by the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Council for Best Practices to assist states in the development and adoption of common College and Career Readiness Standards for Mathematics. Also under development by this coalition is a set of common core state mathematics standards for grades K-12. These sets of standards, together with advances in information technologies, may have a significant influence on the textbook curriculum, the implemented curriculum, and the assessed curriculum in US classrooms in the near future. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.",

		"abstract": "Authority roles among teachers and students have traditionally been hierarchal and centered with the expertise and power of the teacher limiting opportunities for students to act with autonomy to build and justify mathematics. In this paper we discuss authority roles for teachers and students that have been realized in an inquiry-based university, honors calculus classroom. We define and discuss four types of authority we identified from video data: institutional, expertise, mathematical, and performative. We suggest that the institutional authority of the instructor is present whether or not she is acting with the intention to bear authority, thereby interfering with the instructor's ability to share authority with her students. Further, we believe that the traditional focus on the bearer of authority limits our ability to create environments wherein authority can be shared. Instead we suggest that a focus on empowering the receiver to recognize expertise and mathematical authorities may be more fruitful. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

		"abstract": "The invention of the computer has led to the establishment of a new research paradigm, computation, which has recently become more and more popular in scientific exploration. However, computation is not well represented in high school and university curricula in science and engineering, although it applies to a wide range of disciplines beyond computer science and software engineering. In light of the increasing need to provide students with computational education, this paper presents a novel way to develop computational thinking among students. The proposed approach is based on the implementation of Papert's theory of constructionism in electronic spreadsheets. In this approach, students build their knowledge while constructing the difference equation that describes a physical (or engineering) phenomenon, based on specific cases investigated in the spreadsheet. The method does not require the students to write code or perform complex calculations in the spreadsheet and makes it possible to teach advanced subjects at a relatively early stage. The method is demonstrated through contents taken from the secondary and tertiary curricula in mechanics and electromagnetism. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

This fact is bad in all cases, but even more in the case of those students who will be mathematics teachers in school. In this paper it is argued that the history of mathematics may be an efficient element to provide students with flexibility, open-mindedness and motivation towards mathematics. The theoretical background of this work relies both on recent research in mathematics education and on papers written by mathematicians of the past. Opinions are supported with examples. One example concerns a historical presentation of ‘definition’; it was developed with mathematics students who will become mathematics teachers.

		"abstract": "Public concerns about biotechnology have resulted in greater attention being paid to the mechanisms by which biotechnology is communicated with non-scientists, including the provision of science communication training. As undergraduate and postgraduate courses form the foundation of the biotechnology sector by providing a pipeline of university graduates entering into the profession, it has been proposed that formal science communication training be introduced at this early stage of career development. Using an Australian biotechnology degree course as a case study, this paper examines science communication training within this course and the views of past and present students towards this training. Interviews were undertaken with 22 stakeholders in the case, including undergraduate lecturers (who also supervise postgraduate research students), doctoral candidates and biotechnologists recently graduated from the course. Few of the students felt the course provided them with any form of science communication training, let alone training in how to engage non-scientists. Many were unaware of the training available to them and few of the lecturers were able to identify where communication skills are taught within the course. A previous study of this case has also shown that biotechnology undergraduates taking this course do not value communication with non-scientists. Clearly, the current state of science communication training for these students needs to be improved if they are to enter the biotechnology workforce as able civic scientists. The findings of this study may be useful for other university biotechnology courses which have yet to integrate science communication training into their curriculum. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.",

This study investigated prospective secondary mathematics teachers' interpretations of students' thinking as manifested in students' work that embodied solutions of mathematical modelling tasks. The data were collected from 25 prospective mathematics teachers enrolled in an undergraduate course through four 2-week-long cycles. Analysis of data revealed that the prospective teachers interpreted students' thinking in four ways: describing, questioning, explaining, and comparing. Moreover, whereas some of the prospective teachers showed a tendency to increase their attention to the meaning of students' ways of thinking more while they engaged in students' work in depth over time and experience, some of them continued to focus on only judging the accuracy of students' thinking. The implications of the findings for understanding and developing prospective teachers' ways of interpreting students' thinking are discussed.",

		"abstract": "An enduring challenge in mathematics education is to create learning environments in which students generate, refine, and extend their intuitive and informal ways of reasoning to more sophisticated and formal ways of reasoning. Pressing concerns for research, therefore, are to detail students' progressively sophisticated ways of reasoning and instructional design heuristics that can facilitate this process. In this article we analyze the case of student reasoning with analytic expressions as they reinvent solutions to systems of two differential equations. The significance of this work is twofold: it includes an elaboration of the Realistic Mathematics Education instructional design heuristic of emergent models to the undergraduate setting in which symbolic expressions play a prominent role, and it offers teachers insight into student thinking by highlighting qualitatively different ways that students reason proportionally in relation to this instructional design heuristic. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

		"abstract": "A literature review establishes a working definition of recreational mathematics: a type of play which is enjoyable and requires mathematical thinking or skills to engage with. Typically, it is accessible to a wide range of people and can be effectively used to motivate engagement with and develop understanding of mathematical ideas or concepts. Recreational mathematics can be used in education for engagement and to develop mathematical skills, to maintain interest during procedural practice and to challenge and stretch students. It can also make cross-curricular links, including to history of mathematics. In undergraduate study, it can be used for engagement within standard curricula and for extra-curricular interest. Beyond this, there are opportunities to develop important graduate-level skills in problem-solving and communication. The development of a module ‘Game Theory and Recreational Mathematics’ is discussed. This provides an opportunity for fun and play, while developing graduate skills. It teaches some combinatorics, graph theory, game theory and algorithms/complexity, as well as scaffolding a Pólya-style problem-solving process. Assessment of problem-solving as a process via examination is outlined. Student feedback gives some indication that students appreciate the aims of the module, benefit from the explicit focus on problem-solving and understand the active nature of the learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We undertook an online survey, with significant follow-up correspondence, to gather data on current curricula and received replies from 46 (63%) of the departments who teach a BSc mathematics degree. We found that 78% of BSc degree courses in mathematics included computer programming in a compulsory module but 11% of mathematics degree programmes do not teach programming to all their undergraduate mathematics students. In 2016, programming is most commonly taught to undergraduate mathematics students through imperative languages, notably MATLAB, using numerical analysis as the underlying (or parallel) mathematical subject matter. Statistics is a very popular choice in optional courses, using the package R. Computer algebra systems appear to be significantly less popular for compulsory first-year courses than a decade ago, and there was no mention of logic programming, functional programming or automatic theorem proving software. The modal form of assessment of computing modules is entirely by coursework (i.e. no examination). © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

They not only help in enhancing problem solving skills of most individuals, but also help visualise solutions to problems in a better way. Research supports the claim that calculator use improves student performance in computation, concept development, and problem-solving although a growing number of studies show that there may be a class of errors and misconceptions that are induced by calculators. We review some basic ideas of errors in numerical analysis and discuss in detail the concept of round-off error that is often noticed by both college teachers and high school and undergraduate students when working with such computing aids. We then present experimental results on the performance of a variety of computing aids for solving two problems, perform a statistical analysis of data collected from 215 students in the freshmen calculus class at Texas Tech University, and report the findings of this analysis.

		"abstract": "Research shows that students, and sometimes teachers, have trouble with fractions, especially conceiving of fractions as numbers that extend the whole number system. This paper explores how fractions are addressed in undergraduate mathematics courses for prospective elementary teachers (PSTs). In particular, we explore how, and whether, the instructors of these courses address fractions as an extension of the whole number system and fractions as numbers in their classrooms. Using a framework consisting of four approaches to the development of fractions found in history, we analyze fraction lessons videotaped in six mathematics classes for PSTs. Historically, the first two approaches-part-whole and measurement-focus on fractions as parts of wholes rather than numbers, and the last two approaches-division and set theory-formalize fractions as numbers. Our results show that the instructors only implicitly addressed fraction-as-number and the extension of fractions from whole numbers, although most of them mentioned or emphasized these aspects of fractions during interviews. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

We present the characteristics of the successful and unsuccessful provers regarding the purposes, strategies, and affordances of example use, offer detailed accounts of a few illustrative cases of students’ proving processes, and highlight a couple factors that seemed to have hindered the unsuccessful provers’ ability to gain greater affordances from examples.

The function of graphs and gestures in the creation and subsequent use of the Euler method algorithm is explored. If students' primary goal was algorithmatizing 'from scratch', they used imagery of graphing and gesturing as a tool for reasoning.

Schommer's (Journal of Educational Psychology, 82, 495-504, 1990) multidimensional theory of personal epistemology provided the structural framework for the development of 36 domain specific Q sort statements. Analysis of the data revealed three distinct but related views of learning mathematics which were labeled Active Learners, Skeptical Learners, and Confident Learners. Chi-square tests of independence revealed no significant differences based on gender. Additionally, there was no evidence for differences based on level of mathematics completed, age, or college hours accumulated. Student's previous experiences in instructional environments, however, were closely associated with beliefs.

		"abstract": "Teachers who engage primary school students in informal statistical inference (ISI) must themselves have good content knowledge of ISI (ISI-CK). However, little is known about how college education for pre-service teachers can contribute to the development of their ISI-CK. To address this shortcoming, we used a case study to investigate ISI-CK development in a class of 21 pre-service primary school teachers who participated in a short intervention (180 min). Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the pretest, posttest and intervention data, the results suggest that most participants acknowledged it is possible to make uncertain inferences. An assignment to search the media for inferential claims seemed to create awareness regarding inference and the need to distinguish between a sample and a population. A simulation involving random sampling and varied sample size probably increased the participants’ knowledge of sampling variability and random sampling. No development was seen in the participants’ knowledge about sufficient sample sizes. The statistical investigation conducted by the participants during a model lesson may have strengthened their awareness of ISI, but it also revealed that many participants continued to favour distributed sampling over random sampling. Further research on belief formation with regard to data as evidence, sampling methods and the expression of uncertainty in the context of ISI is needed. © 2018, The Author(s).",

		"abstract": "This article addresses the issue of transition from secondary to post-secondary education through collaborative research with teachers from both levels. It takes into account implicit elements in this transition. Research on the transition in mathematics education tends to focus more on the tertiary level, studying difficulties encountered by students or comparing curricula, tasks, and textbooks highlighting disruptions or cultural shifts. However, according to Hall (1959), and Artigue (2004) in a mathematical context, it is the implicit “ways of doing” that lead to the greatest cultural differences. In this article, attention is paid to the particular ways in which teachers’ ways of doing mathematics impact the transition. Ethnomethodology (Garfinkel, 1967) and its central concept of ethnomethods are used as the theoretical framework to conceptualize these ways of doing mathematics. A breaching situation presented to a group of secondary- and tertiary-level teachers engaged in collaborative research (Desgagné et al., 2001) brings to light familiar ways of doing mathematics. Our analysis focuses specifically on a comparison of the ways of doing mathematics related to functions at each level. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

One way to do this is by developing a dedicated mathematics subject to teach modelling and mathematical concepts in biological contexts. We describe such a subject at a research-intensive Australian university, and discuss the considerations informing its design. We also present an investigation into the effect of mathematical and biological background, prior mathematical achievement, and gender, on student achievement in the subject. The investigation shows that several factors known to predict performance in standard calculus subjects apply also to specialized discipline-specific mathematics subjects, and give some insight into the relative importance of mathematical versus biological background for a biology-focused mathematics subject. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Prospective elementary teachers (PSTs) (n = 121) engaged in a problem solving activity each week in class. Data were collected from PSTs enrolled in an undergraduate elementary mathematics methods course at a Southeastern State University over multiple semesters (six semesters, seven classes). PSTs’ solution methods for one intentionally misleading mathematics problem were analyzed using a convergent parallel mixed methods content analysis. Two-thirds of PSTs misunderstood the problem scenario and directly translated numbers from the problem text. PSTs who answered correctly used a problem model strategy to comprehend the scenario and were more likely to use multiple models, draw a diagram, and draw a diagram before using another model. However, a large number of PSTs who answered incorrectly also used multiple models and drew diagrams. Self-correction was not common (8 of 121), because their equations did not provide feedback or support comprehension. Three kinds of imprecision also affected problem comprehension and were evident in both correct and incorrect solutions. Intentionally misleading problems helped PSTs see consequences of their mathematical habits and highlighted the importance of sense making and precision when creating problem models. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

		"abstract": "Most students in U.S. universities are required to take a collection of core courses regardless of their degree or major. These courses are known as \"general education\" courses. The general education requirements typically include at least one mathematics course. Unfortunately each year hundreds of thousands of students in the US do not succeed in these general education mathematics courses causing them to act as a barrier to degree completion. Low student success rates in these courses are pervasive, and it is well documented that the U.S. needs to improve student success and retention in general education mathematics courses. In this paper, we compare the impact of a new instructional style on student retention and success in three general education mathematics courses. The new instructional style, that we have dubbed the Memphis Mathematics Method (MMM), is a blended learning instructional model, developed in conjunction with the National Center for Academic Transformation (NCAT). Our control consists of conventional lectures using identical syllabuses. The data contains 12,261enrollments in College Algebra, Foundations of Mathematics, and Elementary Calculus over the Fall 2007 to Spring 2010 terms at the University of Memphis. Our results show the MMM was positive and significant for raising success rates particularly in Elementary Calculus. In addition, the results show the MMM as a potential vehicle for closing the achievement gap between black and white students in such courses. © Research Information 2012.",

The aim was the investigation of tangency images that settle after undergraduates’ distancing from the notion for a few months and after their participation in university admission examination. To this end we related the performances of the undergraduates and the pupils in the same questions of a questionnaire; we classified the undergraduates in distinct groups through Latent Class Analysis; and, we examined this classification according to the Analytical Local, Geometrical Global and Intermediate Local perspectives on tangency we had identified among pupils. The findings suggest that more undergraduates than pupils demonstrated intermediate perspectives on tangency. Also, the undergraduates’ settled images were influenced by persistent images about tangency and their prior experience in the context of preparation for and participation in the examination.

One class in each pair used the UCSMP Advanced Algebra curriculum, and the other used the 2nd-year-algebra text in place at the school. Achievement was measured by a multiple-choice posttest and a free-response posttest. Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) measures were used to ensure that items were fair to both groups of students. UCSMP students generally outper formed comparison students on multistep problems and problems involving applications or graphical representations. Both groups performed comparably on items testing algebraic skills. Hence, concerns that students studying from a Standards-oriented curriculum will achieve less than students studying from a traditional curriculum are not substantiated in this instance.

At the end of the course, students were assessed by carrying out individual work projects on real-life problems, which was innovative for universities in this country. A concrete example of one of these assessment projects is described. Students produced high-quality work, some of which formed the basis of future papers. In a feedback loop, the student projects were used in later courses as examples to illustrate the use of different techniques and to provide teaching material tailored to the needs of different university specialties. The course has gone through processes of transformation and continuous improvement, which are reflected in students' positive opinions of the course. A detailed analysis of these opinions and students' suggestions is presented. (Contains 16 tables.)",

		"abstract": "Beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing have been investigated extensively in educational and developmental psychology research. Hofer's framework on personal epistemology is adopted in the present study for assessing Lebanese university students' epistemologies of science. Participants were 213 students in their first year of science-related studies at a private university in Beirut. Two instruments were used for data collection: The science-focused epistemological beliefs questionnaire (Hofer, 2000) and an 8-item instrument adapted from the modified version of the \"Views on Science-Technology-Society\" (Dogan & Abd-El-Khalick, 2008), and an additional item developed by the authors. Thirty students were purposively selected for completing the second instrument followed by a semi-structured interview. Data analysis yielded the following assertions regarding students' epistemologies of science: (1) Scientific knowledge is liable to change; (2) the source of scientists' knowledge is inherent to human's construction, whereas the source of personal knowledge is independent from human subjectivity and based on external authority; (3) scientific knowledge is proven and validated through the concerted effort of scientists; and (4) absolute truth cannot be attained because of the lack of means to access knowledge. Findings highlighted the need to foster an academic culture that promotes students' epistemologies and explicitly addresses the nature and processes of science in curricula and instruction.",

		"abstract": "Thermal physics is in the realm of everyday experience, underlies current environmental concerns, and underpins studies in sciences, health and engineering. In the state of NSW in Australia, the coverage of thermal topics in high school is minimal, and, hence, so is the conceptual understanding of students. This study takes a new approach at exploring conceptions of students with a qualitative analysis facilitated by NVivo complemented with reference to sociocultural ideas of learning. A 2-part pen and paper question was given to 598 first year university students of different educational backgrounds (and therefore physics expertise). \"The Question\" was based on 2 familiar scenarios and required the selection of a concept first, followed by an explanation. The results showed that concepts were favoured based on a student's everyday experience and their curriculum through high school, and some were more effective than others in making scientifically congruent responses. The reported thermal physics alternative conceptions were also examined in our sample, and students' reasoning behind such conceptions indicate that some conceptions do not inhibit scientifically congruent responses whilst others do. The results implicate language and the everyday experiences of the student in the teaching and learning of thermal physics.",

		"abstract": "Many universities issue mathematical diagnostic tests to incoming first-year students, covering a range of the basic concepts with which they should be comfortable from secondary school. As far as many lecturers are concerned, the purpose of this test is to determine the students' mathematical knowledge on entry. It should also provide an early indication of which students are likely to need additional help, and hopefully encourage such students to avail of extra support mechanisms at an early stage. However, it is not clear that students recognize these intentions and there is a fear that students who score poorly in the test will have their confidence further damaged in relation to mathematics and will be reluctant to seek help. To this end, a questionnaire was developed to explore students' perspectives on diagnostic testing. Analysis of responses received to the questionnaire provided an interesting insight into students' perspectives including the optimum time to conduct such a test, their views on the aims of diagnostic testing, whether they feel that testing is a good idea, and their attitudes to the support systems put in place to help those who scored poorly in the test.",

		"abstract": "Finding ways for the majority of students to better understand conventional normal theory-based statistical inference seems to be an intractable problem area for researchers. In this paper we propose a conceptual pathway for developing confidence interval ideas for the one-sample situation only from an intuitive sense to bootstrapping for students from about age 14 to first-year university. We make the case that conceptual development should start early; that probability and statistical instruction should change so that both orientate students towards interconnected stochastic conceptions; and that the use of visual imagery has the potential to stimulate students towards such a perspective. We analyse our conceptual pathway based on a theoretical framework for a stochastic conception of statistical inference based on imagery and some research evidence. Our analysis suggests that the pathway has the potential for students to become conversant with the concepts underpinning inference, to view statistics probabilistically and to integrate concepts into a coherent comprehension of inference.

		"abstract": "Students' motivational characteristics, e.g., subject-related interest, are considered important predictors for successful learning processes. However, few empirical studies provide evidence for the assumed chain of effects between high interest and high achievement in mathematics. One reason for this result might be that the applied measures of learners' interest in mathematics are not well aligned with the characteristics of the learning content in the respective educational settings. At the transition from school to university, the character of mathematics shifts from a strongly application oriented school subject to a scientific discipline. When students are asked to rate their interest concerning mathematics learning in general, it is not clear which character of mathematics they refer to (in their ratings). To provide a more differentiated picture of learners' interest, we developed questionnaires that survey students' interest concerning the different characters of mathematics explicitly. With a sample of 323 students from academic mathematics programs, we analysed the quality of the developed scales and whether it is possible to differentiate interest facets according to the different characters of mathematics. In this contribution, we present the development of the instruments. The results of exploratory factor analyses and correlation analyses provide support for the quality of the developed instruments. Our results indicate that indeed the character of mathematics addressed in the questionnaire strongly influences students' self-reports. Finally, we study how the differentiated interest constructs are related to general ratings of interest in mathematics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "At a time when many countries wish to improve their capacity in terms of scientifically and technologically educated young people, mathematics has an increasingly important role to play in support of this agenda. International studies tend to lead to headlines about performance and achievement, but widening participation in mathematics requires more than this. Fundamentally, we need students to develop positive dispositions towards mathematics and continued study of the subject. The articles brought together in this special issue explore underlying issues reporting on the work of a research project that focused on two different programmes of mathematical study in the first year of post-compulsory study in England. The wide-ranging work that is reported provides timely insights, through both quantitative and qualitative lenses, as students in transition negotiate their identities as young people in general, and in relation to mathematics in particular.

Three selected reports from this cohort of project reports are used to investigate and present empirical evidence for learning potentials of integrating history and philosophy in mathematics education. The three projects are: (1) a history project about the use of mathematics in biology that exhibits different epistemic cultures in mathematics and biology. (2) An educational project about the difficulties of learning mathematics that connects to the philosophy of mathematics. (3) A history of mathematics project that connects to the sociology of multiple discoveries.

		"abstract": "In this paper, we describe and investigate three aspects of learning mathematics: intention, approach and outcome. These aspects have emerged from interviews with students where their experience of learning mathematics, their understanding of mathematics as a discipline field, and their perception of work as a mathematician were the objects of study. We focus here on the complex nature of the students' intentions for learning, approaches to learning and outcomes of learning. We present a theoretical model based on our research findings, aiming to build on and expand earlier descriptions of students' learning approaches, such as the surface and deep approach of Marton and Saljo (1976) and the 3P model of Biggs (1999).",

		"abstract": "Empirical research shows that students often use reasoning founded on copying algorithms or recalling facts (imitative reasoning) when solving mathematical tasks. Research also indicate that a focus on this type of reasoning might weaken the students' understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. It is therefore important to study the types of reasoning students have to perform in order to solve exam tasks and pass exams. The purpose of this study is to examine what types of reasoning students taking introductory calculus courses are required to perform. Tasks from 16 exams produced at four different Swedish universities were analyzed and sorted into task classes. The analysis resulted in several examples of tasks demanding different types of mathematical reasoning. The results also show that about 70% of the tasks were solvable by imitative reasoning and that 15 of the exams could be passed using only imitative reasoning.",

		"abstract": "The 2-year introductory study programme in the natural sciences (Nat-Bas) at Roskilde University is an example of a project organised, participant directed, problem oriented, and interdisciplinary science study programme. The paper gives an account of the organisational framework around the project work, and discusses in particular, the thematic organisation of project work, the notion of exemplarity, the problem orientation, the interdisciplinary nature of the problems, the assessment of the project work, and the students' individual learning. Based on descriptions and analyses of six selected project reports from the Nat-Bas in 2005-2007, we illustrate the multiple perspectives of science and mathematics and the learning potentials found in the project work. The paper is concluded with a general discussion of the quality of the project work and its educational function in the Nat-Bas programme. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

		"abstract": "Graphing calculators are hand-held technological tools currently used in mathematics classrooms. Teachers' perspectives on using graphing calculators are important in terms of exploring what teachers think about using such technology in advanced mathematics courses, particularly precalculus courses. A descriptive intrinsic case study was conducted to analyse the perspectives of 11 teachers using graphing calculators with potential Computer Algebra System (CAS) capability while teaching \"Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry,\" a precalculus course for 11th-grade students developed by the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project. Data were collected from multiple sources as part of a curriculum evaluation study conducted during the 2007-2008 school year. Although all teachers were using the same curriculum that integrated CAS into the instructional materials, teachers had mixed views about the technology. Graphing calculator features were used much more than CAS features, with many teachers concerned about the use of CAS because of pressures from external assessments. In addition, several teachers found it overwhelming to learn a new technology at the same time they were learning a new curriculum. The results have implications for curriculum developers and others working with teachers to update curriculum and the use of advanced technologies simultaneously.",

		"abstract": "In Maths for Business, a mathematics module for non-mathematics specialists, students are given the choice of completing the module content via short online videos, live lectures or a combination of both. In this study, we identify students’ specific usage patterns with both of these resources and discuss their reasons for the preferences they exhibit. In 2015–2016, we collected quantitative data on each student's resource usage (attendance at live lectures and access of online videos) for the entire class of 522 students and employed model-based clustering which identified four distinct resource usage patterns with lectures and/or videos. We also collected qualitative data on students’ perceptions of resource usage through a survey administered at the end of the semester, to which 161 students responded. The 161 survey responses were linked to each cluster and analysed using thematic analysis. Perceived benefits of videos include flexibility of scheduling and pace, and avoidance of large, long lectures. In contrast, the main perceived advantages of lectures are the ability to engage in group tasks, to ask questions, and to learn ‘gradually’. Students in the two clusters with high lecture attendance achieved, on average, higher marks in the module. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

A proof may have different flows, depending on the lecturer’s choices regarding its presentation. Adopting Perelman’s New Rhetoric (PNR) as a theoretical framework, we designed methods to assess aspects of the flow of a proof. We present a case study from a Number Theory class at the beginning undergraduate level, focusing on an intervention concerning one lesson given in two consecutive years. The intervention consisted of a discussion with the lecturer about findings from Year-1 and potential changes in the flow of the proof before the Year-2 lesson. We analyze two aspects of the flow of the proof: the scope and organization of the argumentation and the presence (in the PNR sense) of different elements. Our analysis revealed that the intervention caused global and local changes in the flow and that PNR enables us to capture these changes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

We undertook a long-term study about the construction of examples and counter-examples in a college level calculus course. The subjects were three pairs of first year students majoring in mathematics/physics at the University of Fes (Morocco). In addition to the instructional role of constructing examples and counter-examples, our research addressed the students' thought processes. For this propose, their interactions, as well as all their verbal and written productions were collected and transcribed. Each sentence was then classified according to the four qualitative variables: Activity, Expression, Content and Correctness. A factor analysis put in evidence two types of strategies that we interpreted as global and local ones. In addition, a qualitative analysis allowed us to distinguish between 'winning' and 'losing' strategies. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

		"abstract": "We were interested in exploring the extent to which advanced mathematics lecturers provide students with opportunities to play a role in considering or generating course content. To do this, we examined the questioning practices of 11 lecturers who taught advanced mathematics courses at the university level. Because we are unaware of other studies examining advanced mathematics lecturers’ questioning, we first analyzed the data using an open coding scheme to categorize the types of content lecturers solicited and the opportunities they provided students to participate in generating course content. In a second round of analysis, we examined the extent to which lecturers provide students with opportunities to generate mathematical contributions and to engage in reasoning that researchers have identified as important in advanced mathematics. Our findings highlight that, although lecturers asked many questions, lecturers did not provide substantial opportunities for students to participate in generating mathematical content and reasoning. Additionally, we provide several examples of lecturers providing students with some opportunities to generate important contributions. We conclude by providing implications and areas for future research.",

		"abstract": "This paper investigates outcomes of building students' intuitive understanding of a limit as a function's predicted value by examining introductory calculus students' conceptions of limit both before and after instruction. Students' responses suggest that while this approach is successful at reducing the common \"limit equals function value\" misconception of a limit, new misconceptions emerged in students' responses. Analysis of students' reasoning indicates a lack of covariational reasoning that coordinates changes in both \"x\" and \"y\" may be at the root of the emerging \"limit reached near x = c\" misconception. These results suggest that although dynamic interpretations of limit may be intuitive for many students, care must be taken to foster a dynamic conception that is both useful at the introductory calculus level and is in line with the formal notion of limit learned in advanced mathematics. In light of the findings, suggestions for adapting the pedagogical approach used in this study are provided.",

We first videorecorded a lecture delivered by an experienced professor who had a reputation for being an outstanding instructor. Using video recall, we then interviewed the professor to determine the ideas that he intended to convey and how he tried to convey these ideas in this lecture. We also interviewed 6 students to see what they understood from this lecture. The students did not comprehend the ideas that the professor cited as central to his lecture. Based on our analyses, we propose 2 factors to account for why students did not understand these ideas.",

		"abstract": "Access to advanced study in mathematics, in general, and to calculus, in particular, depends in part on the conceptual architecture of these knowledge domains. In this paper, we outline an alternative conceptual architecture for elementary calculus. Our general strategy is to separate basic concepts from the particular advanced techniques used in their definition and exposition. We develop the beginning concepts of differential and integral calculus using only concepts and skills found in secondary algebra and geometry. It is our underlining objective to strengthen students' knowledge of these topics in an effort to prepare them for advanced mathematics study. The purpose of this reconstruction is not to alter the teaching of limit-based calculus but rather to affect students' learning and understanding of mathematics in general by introducing key concepts during secondary mathematics courses. This approach holds the promise of strengthening more students' understanding of limit-based calculus and enhancing their potential for success in post-secondary mathematics.",

To probe the students' thinking, we interviewed them while they were working on tasks involvingvarious aspects of isomorphism. Here are some of the observations that emerged from analysis of the interviews. First, students show a strong need for \"canonical\", unique, step-by-step procedures and tend to get stuck of having to deal with some degrees of freedom in their choices. Second, students exhibit various degrees of personification and localization in their language, as in \"I can find a function that takes every element of G to every element of GJ'' vs. \"there exists a function from G to G'\". Third, when having to deal with a list of properties, students choose first the properties they perceive as simpler; however, it turns out that their choice depends on the type of the task and the type of complexity involved. That is, in tasks involvinggroups in general, students mostly prefer to work with properties which are syntactically simple, whereas in tasks involving specific groups, students prefer properties which are computationally simpler.",

The data are analyzed from the perspective of reducing abstraction, which aims to explain students’ conceptions of abstract algebra concepts. From this perspective, most students’ responses and conceptions can be attributed to their tendency to work on a lower level of abstraction than the level on which concepts are introduced in class.

For this purpose twenty ﬁrst-year mathematics undergraduates were observed in their weekly tutorials in four Oxford Colleges during the ﬁrst two terms of Year 1. Tutorials were tape-recorded and ﬁeldnotes kept during observation. The students were also interviewed at the end of each term of observation. During data analysis, sets of Episodes were extracted from the transcripts of the tutorials and the interviews within ﬁve topics in pure mathematics. This topical analysis was followed by a cross-topical synthesis of themes that were found to characterise the novices’ cognition. Here, in three characteristic Episodes, I discuss issues related to the learning of one mathematical topic, Group Theory, and in particular: 1. The static and operational duality within the concept of order of an element as well as the semantic abbreviation contained in |g| 2. The often problematic use of ‘times’ and ‘powers of’ in association with the group operation. 3. The ambivalent use of geometric images as part of meaning bestowing processes with regard to the notion of coset. 4. The problematic conceptualisation of the multi-level abstractions embedded in the concept of isomorphism.",

Based on interviews with undergraduate students and on written questionnaires, a theoretical framework evolved which could coherently account for most of the data. According to this theoretical framework, students’ responses can be interpreted as a result of reducing the level of abstraction. In this paper, the theme of reducing abstraction is examined, based on three interpretations for levels of abstraction discussed in mathematics education research literature. From these three perspectives on abstraction, ways in which students reduce abstraction level are analyzed and exempliﬁed.",

In this paper, I ﬁrst demonstrate that undergraduates often are aware of and able to apply the facts required to prove a statement but still fail to prove it. They thus fail to construct a proof because they could not use the syntactic knowledge that they had. By comparing doctoral students and undergraduates constructing proofs in abstract algebra, I have hypothesized four types of ‘strategic knowledge’ – knowledge of how to choose which facts and theorems to apply –which the doctoral students appeared to possess and undergraduates did not. The doctoral students appeared to know the powerful proof techniques in abstract algebra, which theorems are most important, when particular facts and theorems are likely to be useful, and when one should or should not try and prove theorems using symbol manipulation.",

We deﬁne a syntactic proof production to occur when the prover draws inferences by manipulating symbolic formulae in a logically permissible way. We deﬁne a semantic proof production to occur when the prover uses instantiations of mathematical concepts to guide the formal inferences that he or she draws. We present two independent exploratory case studies from group theory and real analysis that illustrate both types of proofs. We conclude by discussing what types of concept understanding are required for each type of proof production and by illustrating the weaknesses of syntactic proof productions.",

We will explain the transition from examples to abstract algebra as a series of shifts of attention and in this paper we will use a case study to examine the initial shift, which we will call apprehending a structure, and examine how one student came to apprehend the structure of the commutative ring Z99.",

We present an episode from an undergraduate abstract algebra classroom to illustrate the guided reinvention of mathematics through processes that strongly parallel those described by Lakatos. Our analysis suggests that the constructs described by Lakatos can provide a useful framework for making sense of the mathematical activity in classrooms where students are actively engaged in the development of mathematical ideas and provide design heuristics for instructional approaches that support the learning of mathematics through the process of guided reinvention.",

We describe and compare four perspectives—mathematics, mathematics education, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology—each offering a different view on mathematical thinking and learning and, in particular, on the source of mathematical errors and on ways of dealing with them in the classroom. The four perspectives represent four levels of explanation, and we see them not as competing but as complementing each other. In the classroom or in research data, all four perspectives may be observed. They may differentially account for the behavior of different students on the same task, the same student in different stages of development, or even the same student in different stages of working on a complex task. We first introduce each of the perspectives by reviewing its basic ideas and research base. We then show each perspective at work, by applying it to the analysis of typical mathematical misconceptions. Our illustrations are based on two tasks: one from statistics (taken from the psychological research literature) and one from abstract algebra (based on our own research).",

Participants, all of whom had recently completed coursework in abstract algebra, were asked to explain concepts connected to the school mathematics curriculum, such as division by zero and even numbers. The analysis shows that students used three distinct explanatory strategies: Abstract Mathematical Argument, Analogy, and Rules. Students experienced competition among and within strategies. Moreover, students often derived different conclusions using different strategies. When faced with this conflict, they felt compelled to choose a strategy and to draw a conclusion derived from applying that strategy, regardless of sense-making. Students’ ability to integrate explanatory strategies appeared to depend on their possession of coherent mathematical meanings, suggesting that strategy integration is indicative of students’ having a key developmental understanding of the underlying mathematical ideas.",

		"abstract": "The group isomorphism theorem is an important subject in any abstract algebra undergraduate course; nevertheless, research shows that it is seldom understood by students. We use APOS theory and propose a genetic decomposition that separates it into two statements: the first one for sets and the second with added structure. We administered a questionnaire to students from top Chilean universities and selected some of these students for interviews to gather information about the viability of our genetic decomposition. The students interviewed were divided in two groups based on their familiarity with equivalence relations and partitions. Students who were able to draw on their intuition of partitions were able to reconstruct the group theorem from the set theorem, while those who stayed on the purely algebraic side could not. Since our approach to learning this theorem was successful, it may be worthwhile to gather data while teaching it the way we propose here in order to check how much the learning of the group isomorphism theorem is improved. This approach could be expanded to other group homomorphism theorems provided further analysis is conducted: going from the general (e.g., sets) to the particular (e.g., groups) might not always the best strategy, but in some cases we may just be turning to more familiar settings.",

Chevallard and his collaborators, and from the institutional perspective of university mathematics education in France. It focuses on the teaching and learning of algebraic structures. The article introduces the notion of structuralist praxeology in the theory of teaching and learning of Abstract Algebra. The notion is illustrated by detailed descriptions of structuralist praxeologies related to the arithmetic of abstract rings, identified, on the one hand, in the history of mathematics and in Abstract Algebra textbooks and, on the other, in interactions among a group of learners of Abstract Algebra on an online discussion forum. The theoretical (and practical) issues regarding the teaching and learning of the structuralist praxeologies are discussed in the context of the difficulties that learners experience in the transition from undergraduate and graduate studies in mathematics at university. The article concludes with an outline of a research program based on further praxeological analyses of the tasks, methods, methodologies and theories characteristic of structuralist thinking in a teaching and learning environment.",

It focuses on students’ difficulties as these are related to the object-level and metalevel mathematical learning in group theory, and, when possible, highlights any commognitive conflicts. In the data analysis, one can identify three types of difficulties, relevant to object-level learning: namely regarding the frequently observed confusion between groups and sets, the object-level rules of visual mediators, and the object-level rules of contextual notions, such as permutations, exponentials, sets and matrices. In addition, data analysis suggests two types of difficulties, relevant to metalevel learning. The first refers to the actual proof that the three conditions of subgroup test hold, and the second is related to syntactic inaccuracies, incomplete argumentation and problematic use of visual mediators. Finally, this study suggests that there are clear links between object-level and metalevel learning, mainly due to the fact that objectification of the various relevant mathematical notions influences the endorsement of the governing metarules.",

In particular, a concept map task is used to understand the degree to which participants, having recently taken an abstract algebra course, situated inverse functions within its group structure (i.e., the set of invertible functions under composition). In addition, their particular conceptions of functions and function composition throughout the interviews were then also considered as a means to explore further their responses during the interviews. Findings indicate that only two participants showed evidence of the desirable mathematically powerful understandings from abstract algebra in relation to inverse functions, and further analysis suggests a variety of challenges in terms of developing meaningful connections, which were more related to conceptions about secondary content than to the abstract algebra content. Implications for the mathematical preparation of secondary teachers are discussed.",

These proofs are typically valid otherwise. However, such proofs are invalid because they would prove the false claim that commutativity is preserved by any homomorphism. This observation from practice raises researchable questions: How common is this phenomenon? What is the nature of this phenomenon and can we explain why students produce this type of argument? In this paper, we report a small-scale two-part survey study and a preliminary interview study designed to begin exploring these questions. Our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely quite common and goes beyond a simple omission of a proof detail. Drawing on the research literature and our follow-up interviews, we propose potential explanations for this phenomenon. Finally, we discuss two different ways to think about supporting students who make this error, one that focuses on refining the students’ proofs and one that involves encouraging students to use the conclusion of a statement to structure a proof.",

The objective of this case study is to investigate the conditions and affordances under which students proceed from familiar school mathematical discourses to new, tertiary discourses with a specific perspective on learning processes. The study was located in an upper secondary transition course in a teaching unit on elementary number theory in which highly proficient students in their penultimate year of schooling participated. The main finding is that there was not a linear progression towards the intended tertiary mathematical discourse of modular multiplication but a coexistence of two discourses developing in parallel: the intended tertiary discourse and a continuation of school mathematical discourses. Students see these two discourses as the same, connected by the same perceived aim of searching for patterns. Further hindering discursive development are utterances, in which elements of the intended tertiary discourse (words and representations) are used superfluously, so that elementary/secondary utterances appear to be tertiary. These findings illustrate the need to explicate and address metanarratives. Metanarratives can connect two discourses developing in parallel in ways that, in this case, hinder discursive development towards the intended tertiary discourse.",

However, researchers still find students who complete the mathematical proof process through intuitive thinking. Students who have studied mathematical proof in the early semester should not have completed abstract algebraic proof intuitively. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore students' thinking process in conducting mathematical proof based on Mason's framework. The instrument used to collect data was mathematical proof problems test related to abstract algebra and interviews. There are three out of 25 students who did abstract algebra through intuitive thinking as they only used two stages of the Mason's thinking framework. Then, two out of three students were chosen as the subjects of the study. The selection of research subjects is based on the student's ability to express intuitive thinking verbally process which were conducted while completing the test. It is found that students can form structural-intuitive warrant that they use to complete the mathematical proof of abstract algebra. Structural-intuitive warrant formed by students at the stage of attack and review are in the form of: institutional warrant and evaluative warrant, while at the entry and attack stage are a priori warrant and empirical warrant.",

		"abstract": "Advanced mathematics is seen as an integral component of secondary teacher preparation, and thus most secondary teacher preparation programs require their students to complete an array of advanced mathematics courses. In recent years, though, researchers have questioned the utility of proposed connections between advanced and secondary mathematics. It is simply not clear in many cases—to researchers, teacher educators, and teachers themselves—exactly how advanced mathematics content is related to secondary content. In this paper, we propose using a conceptual analysis—a form of theory in which one explicitly describes ways of reasoning about a particular mathematical idea—to address this issue. Specifically, we use conceptual analyses for the foundational notions of equivalence and inverse to illustrate how the ways of reasoning needed to support productive engagement with tasks in advanced mathematics can mirror and reinforce those that are similarly productive in school mathematics. To do so, we propose conceptual analyses for the key concepts of equivalence and inverse and show how researchers can use these conceptual analyses to identify connections to school mathematics in advanced mathematical tasks that might otherwise be obscured and overlooked. We conclude by suggesting ways in which conceptual analyses might be productively used by both teacher educators and future teachers.",

One approach to address this problem is to implement so-called Concept-Tests. These are multiple-choice questions whose distractors represent common problems and misconceptions related to the concepts.

We therefore developed such questions for important concepts of basic group and ring theory in the years 2020–2022. In this paper, we first want to present the questions and the developmental process. Furthermore, we want to present an empirical study investigating to what extent the questions helped students in a proof-oriented abstract algebra course to acquire an understanding of the concepts covered.

In this study, we designed AoPs that approximated the teaching practices of attending to, interpreting, and deciding how to respond to students’ mathematical thinking (Jacobs et al. in J Res Math Educ 41(2):169–202, 2010), as well as leading a class discussion about the students’ ideas (Smith and Stein in 5 Practices for orchestrating productive mathematics discussion, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Reston, 2018). We conducted interviews with teachers enrolled in a master’s-level Mathematics for Teachers course. The curriculum and interviews focused on three mathematical content domains: probability, abstract algebra, and real analysis. We administered AoPs prompting the teachers to interpret and respond to student thinking and structure whole class discussions about students’ strategies. Through our analysis of their responses, we identified the teachers’ pedagogical mathematical practices (PMPs) (Wasserman in Learn Math 42(3):28–33, 2022), i.e., practices and habits shared by mathematicians and mathematics teachers, used as they responded to these AoPs. We also identified design features of the AoPs that are conducive to teachers’ enactment of certain PMPs. We contribute new PMPs to the literature and provide implications for the advanced mathematical preparation of mathematics teachers.",

Based on qualitative analysis of open response surveys, we compare these groups’ characterizations of sameness; note the subcomponents discussed and variation within each dimension; and highlight experiences influential to students’ perceptions of sameness. Findings include interpretability of sameness as a big idea, nascent development of thematic connections across courses, emphases on current course material rather than connec­ tions to prior courses for students solicited from a particular course, greater reflectiveness from the graduate student group, and abstract algebra as an impactful course.

Here, we report on a study in which we conducted task-based clinical interviews to gain insight into students’ techniques for addressing “is the given relation a function?” tasks. We found that the techniques students employed necessarily extended far beyond those reported in the literature (such as the vertical line test) and relied on the previously undocumented notions of sameness, convention, and ambiguity (for well-defined) and notions of containment, existence, and set operations (for everywhere-defined). These techniques coordinated the domain, codomain, and rule, which previous research has highlighted the importance of but stopped short of directly investigating. Two contributions of this work include identifying successful techniques (as the landscape of functions literature predominantly focuses on challenges and difficulties) and identifying techniques for everywhere-definedness (which had not previously received any direct attention in the literature).",

		"abstract": "This article focuses on the didactic transposition of the homomorphism concept and on the elaboration and evaluation of an activity dedicated to the teaching of this fundamental concept in Abstract Algebra. It does not restrict to Group Theory but on the contrary raises the issue of the teaching and learning of algebraic structuralism, thus bridging Group and Ring Theories and highlighting the phenomenon of thematisation. Emphasis is made on epistemological analysis and its interaction with didactics. The rationale of the isomorphism and homomorphism concepts is discussed, in particular through a textbook analysis focusing on the metadiscourse that mathematicians offer to illuminate the concepts. A piece of didactic engineering, informed by the preceding analysis and using epistemological insight as a meta-lever, is presented. The empirical results of a classroom realisation are discussed in the epistemological framework, through comparison of the a priori and a posteriori analysis. This experiment shows both the potential and the difficulties in connecting the homomorphism formalism to cognitive processes of comparison and identification.",

		"abstract": "Binary operations are one of the fundamental structures underlying our number and algebraic systems. Yet, researchers have often left their role implicit as they model student understanding of abstract structures. In this paper, we directly analyze students’ perceptions of the general binary operation via a two-phase study consisting of task-based surveys and interviews. We document what attributes of binary operation group theory students perceive as critical and what types of metaphors students use to convey these attributes. We found that many students treat superficial features as critical (such as element-operator-element formatting) and do not always perceive critical features as essential (such as the binary attribute). Further, these attributes were communicated across three metaphor categories: arithmetic-related, function-related, and organization-related.",

In this paper, I introduce the Group Theory Concept Assessment (GTCA), a measure created for the purpose of conducting large-scale studies of student conceptual understanding in group theory. The GTCA measures this understanding divorced from proof construction ability. I outline the design process and share results from various stages of analysis and refinement. I then present an item-level analysis of the GTCA including a detailed look at four items. These items focus on subgroups, inverses, quotient groups, and kernels, respectively. I conclude by reflecting on the GTCA’s potential usage as a research tool and practitioner tool.",

		"abstract": "Prior research has shown how incorporating group theory into upper secondary school or undergraduate mathematics education may positively impact learners’ conceptual understanding of mathematics in general and algebraic concepts in particular. Despite a recently increasing number of empirical research into student learning of introductory group theory, the development of a concept inventory that allows for the valid assessment of a respective conceptual understanding constitutes a desideratum to date. In this article, we contribute to closing this gap: We present the development and evaluation of the Concept Inventory of Introductory Group Theory—the CI²GT. Its development is based on a modern mathematics education research perspective regarding students‘ conceptual mathematics understanding. For the evaluation of the CI²GT, we follow a contemporary conception of validity: We report on results from two consecutive studies to empirically justify that our concept inventory allows for a valid test score interpretation. On the one hand, we present N = 9 experts‘ opinions on various aspects of our concept inventory. On the other hand, we administered the CI²GT to N = 143 pre-service primary school teachers as a post-test after a two weeks course into introductory group theory. The data allow for a psychometric characterization of the instrument, both from classical and probabilistic test theory perspectives. It is shown that the CI²GT has good to excellent psychometric properties, and the data show a good ﬁt to the Rasch model. This establishes a valuable new concept inventory for assessing students’ conceptual understanding of introductory group theory and, thus, may serve as a fruitful starting point for future research into student learning of abstract algebra.",

		"abstract": "The concept of inverse is threaded throughout K-16 mathematics. Scholars frequently advocate for students to understand the underlying structure: combining an element and its inverse through the binary operations yields the relevant identity element. This ‘coordinated’ way of reasoning is challenging for students to employ; however, little is known about how students might reason en route to developing it. In this study, we analyze a teaching experiment with two beginning abstract algebra students through the lens of three ways of reasoning about inverse: inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as a coordination of the binary operation, identity, and set. In particular, we examine the implications of these ways of reasoning as students work to develop inverse as a coordination. We identify pedagogical tools and facets of instructional design that appeared to support students’ development of inverse as a coordination. We further suggest that all three ways of reasoning can support productive activity with inverses.",

		"abstract": "Despite the prominence of analogies in mathematics, little attention has been given to exploring students’ processes of analogical reasoning, and even less research exists on revealing how students might be empowered to independently and productively reason by analogy to establish new (to them) mathematics. I argue that the lack of a cohesive framework for interpreting students’ approaches to analogical reasoning in mathematics contributes to this issue. To address this, I introduce the Analogical Reasoning in Mathematics (ARM) framework. Constructed from an analysis of interviews with four abstract algebra students, ARM identifies several analogical activities that serve to analyze students’ analogical reasoning with a finer grain size than was previously possible with existing frameworks. Using this framework, I present an analysis of the students’ constructions of a ring-theoretic analogy to subgroup, thus revealing that even constructing simple analogies can elicit diverse pathways of analogical reasoning across students. Implications for further research related to analogies and analogical reasoning in mathematics education are discussed.",
