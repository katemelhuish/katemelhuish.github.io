abstract: Quotient groups are a foundational topic within abstract algebra courses,
  and they provide a context in which rich, powerful, and vivid language can be used
  to convey an understanding of the mathematics at play. We examined the language
  mathematicians used to describe their instruction on quotient groups and found that
  mathematicians draw on several source domains and use various metaphorical expressions
  when discussing their teaching practices. Of prominence in these findings was the
  use of a construction source domain which spanned all major aspects of quotient
  groups. The use of this source domain afforded the use of many metaphorical expressions
  that are tied to various formal content goals. We detail these findings and discuss
  how the metaphorical expressions used relate to the formal mathematics content that
  mathematicians are trying to convey.
