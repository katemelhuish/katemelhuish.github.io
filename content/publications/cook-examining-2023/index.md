abstract: 'Inverse is a critical topic throughout the K–16 mathematics curriculum
  where students encounter the notion of mathematical inverse across many contexts.
  The literature base on inverses is substantial, yet context-specific and compartmentalized.
  That is, extant research examines students’ reasoning with inverses within specific
  algebraic contexts. It is currently unclear what might be involved in productively
  reasoning with inverses across algebraic contexts, and whether the specific ways
  of reasoning from the literature can be abstracted to more general ways of reasoning
  about inverse. To address this issue, we conducted a standalone literature review
  to explicate and exemplify three cross-context ways of reasoning that, we hypothesize,
  can support students’ productive engagement with inverses in a variety of algebraic
  contexts: inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated element, and inverse as
  a coordination of the binary operation, identity, and set. Findings also include
  expli'
