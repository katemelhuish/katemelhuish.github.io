abstract: "Inverse is a critical topic throughout the K\u201316 mathematics curriculum\
  \ where students encounter the notion of mathematical inverse across many contexts.\
  \ The literature base on inverses is substantial, yet context-specific and compartmentalized.\
  \ That is, extant research examines students\u2019 reasoning with inverses within\
  \ specific algebraic contexts. It is currently unclear what might be involved in\
  \ productively reasoning with inverses across algebraic contexts, and whether the\
  \ specific ways of reasoning from the literature can be abstracted to more general\
  \ ways of reasoning about inverse. To address this issue, we conducted a standalone\
  \ literature review to explicate and exemplify three cross-context ways of reasoning\
  \ that, we hypothesize, can support students\u2019 productive engagement with inverses\
  \ in a variety of algebraic contexts: inverse as an undoing, inverse as a manipulated\
  \ element, and inverse as a coordination of the binary operation, identity, and\
  \ set. Findings also include expli"
