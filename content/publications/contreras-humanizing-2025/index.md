abstract: The Reading and Appreciating Mathematical Proofs (RAMP) project seeks to
  provide novel resources for teaching undergraduate introduction to proof courses
  centered around reading activities. These reading activities include (1) reading
  rich proofs to learn new mathematics through proofs as well as to learn how to read
  proofs for understanding and (2) reading mathematician stories to humanize proving
  and to legitimize challenge and struggle. One of the guiding analogies of the project
  is thinking about learning proof-based mathematics like learning a genre of literature.
  We want students to read interesting proofs so they can appreciate what is exciting
  about the genre and how they can engage with it. Proofs were selected by eight professors
  in mathematics who as curriculum co-authors collected intriguing mathematical results
  and added stories of their experience becoming mathematicians. As mathematicians
  of colour and/or women mathematicians, these co-authors speak to the challenges
