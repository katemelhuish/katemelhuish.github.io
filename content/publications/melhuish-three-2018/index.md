abstract: 'Many studies in mathematics education research occur with a nonrepresentative
  sample and are never replicated. To challenge this paradigm, I designed a large-scale
  study evaluating student conceptions in group theory that surveyed a national, representative
  sample of students. By replicating questions previously used to build theory around
  student understanding of subgroups, cyclic groups, and isomorphism with over 800
  students, I establish the utility of replication studies to (a) validate previous
  results, (b) establish the prevalence of various student conceptions, and (c) reexamine
  theoretical propositions. Data analyzed include 1 round of open-ended surveys, 2
  rounds of closed-form surveys, and 30 follow-up interviews. I illustrate the potential
  of replication studies to refine theory and theoretical propositions in 3 ways:
  by offering alternate interpretations of student responses, by challenging previous
  pedagogical implications, and by reevaluating connections between theories'
