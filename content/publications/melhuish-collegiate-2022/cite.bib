 abstract = {There has been significant growth in the literature base exploring questions of teaching in undergraduate mathematics. In this paper we synthesize the literature on the teaching of proof-based undergraduate mathematics, drawing on 104 published reports from a range of countries and research traditions. We primarily differentiate the papers into those which explore lecture-based pedagogy and student-centered pedagogy. For each type of instruction, we focus on three categories of findings from the literature: description of instruction, instructor beliefs and rationales, and the relationship between instruction and students (cognitive, participatory, affective, and equity oriented). Much is known about the enactment of lecture-based teaching, including instructors’ cognitive and affective goals. The student-centered literature focuses on tensions and challenges implementing curricula with a greater focus on participatory goals. Overall, there are few studies that attempt to link instruc},
