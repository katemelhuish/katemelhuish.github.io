abstract: 'There has been significant growth in the literature base exploring questions
  of teaching in undergraduate mathematics. In this paper we synthesize the literature
  on the teaching of proof-based undergraduate mathematics, drawing on 104 published
  reports from a range of countries and research traditions. We primarily differentiate
  the papers into those which explore lecture-based pedagogy and student-centered
  pedagogy. For each type of instruction, we focus on three categories of findings
  from the literature: description of instruction, instructor beliefs and rationales,
  and the relationship between instruction and students (cognitive, participatory,
  affective, and equity oriented). Much is known about the enactment of lecture-based
  teaching, including instructors’ cognitive and affective goals. The student-centered
  literature focuses on tensions and challenges implementing curricula with a greater
  focus on participatory goals. Overall, there are few studies that attempt to link
  instruc'
