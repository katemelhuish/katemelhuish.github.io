abstract: "There has been significant growth in the literature base exploring questions\
  \ of teaching in undergraduate mathematics. In this paper we synthesize the literature\
  \ on the teaching of proof-based undergraduate mathematics, drawing on 104 published\
  \ reports from a range of countries and research traditions. We primarily differentiate\
  \ the papers into those which explore lecture-based pedagogy and student-centered\
  \ pedagogy. For each type of instruction, we focus on three categories of findings\
  \ from the literature: description of instruction, instructor beliefs and rationales,\
  \ and the relationship between instruction and students (cognitive, participatory,\
  \ affective, and equity oriented). Much is known about the enactment of lecture-based\
  \ teaching, including instructors\u2019 cognitive and affective goals. The student-centered\
  \ literature focuses on tensions and challenges implementing curricula with a greater\
  \ focus on participatory goals. Overall, there are few studies that attempt to link\
