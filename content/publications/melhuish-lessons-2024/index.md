abstract: In recent years, professional organizations in the United States have suggested
  undergraduate mathematics shift away from pure lecture format. Transitioning to
  a student-centered class is a complex instructional undertaking especially in the
  proof-based context. In this paper, we share lessons learned from a design-based
  research project centering instructional elements as objects of design. We focus
  on how three high leverage teaching practices (HLTP; established in the K-12 literature)
  can be adapted to the proof context to promote student engagement in authentic proof
  activity with attention to issues of access and equity of participation. In general,
  we found that HLTPs translated well to the proof setting, but required increased
  attention to navigating between formal and informal mathematics, developing precision
  around mathematical objects, supporting competencies beyond formal proof construction,
  and structuring group work. We position this paper as complementary to existing
