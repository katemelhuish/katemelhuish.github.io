abstract: Mathematics classroom observation protocols are a prevalent way that researchers
  analyze classrooms for purposes such as identifying quality instruction and evaluating
  the impact of instructional interventions. These protocols serve to operationalize
  what counts as quality instruction. However, we have found both in our own scholarship
  and in the mathematics education field at large, the scholar point of view is emphasized
  with minimal critical reflection. We suggest that this preserves dominant ideologies
  that can serve to uphold whiteness in the classroom and allows for racial, gender,
  and cultural bias in tool use. We make a call for attention to QuantCrit tenants
  in the design and use of classroom observation protocols.
