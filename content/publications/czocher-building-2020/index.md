abstract: Persistence in STEM majors largely depends on persistence in mathematics,
  which in turn is predicted by a number of student characteristics including mathematics
  self-efficacy. While previous research has established that mathematics self-efficacy
  is an important predictor of undergraduate STEM persistence, little is known about
  what interventions may support student gains in mathematics self-efficacy at this
  level. To address this gap, we first propose a research-based theory of action arguing
  that modelling-based interventions have the potential to support gains in self-efficacy,
  proficiency, and interest in mathematics. We then present a study of an intervention,
  a mathematical modelling competition, aligned with our theory of action. Our findings
  suggest that such an intervention can promote gains in students' mathematics self-efficacy.
