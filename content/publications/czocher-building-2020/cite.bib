 abstract = {Persistence in STEM majors largely depends on persistence in mathematics, which in turn is predicted by a number of student characteristics including mathematics self-efficacy. While previous research has established that mathematics self-efficacy is an important predictor of undergraduate STEM persistence, little is known about what interventions may support student gains in mathematics self-efficacy at this level. To address this gap, we first propose a research-based theory of action arguing that modelling-based interventions have the potential to support gains in self-efficacy, proficiency, and interest in mathematics. We then present a study of an intervention, a mathematical modelling competition, aligned with our theory of action. Our findings suggest that such an intervention can promote gains in students' mathematics self-efficacy.},
