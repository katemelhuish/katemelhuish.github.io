abstract: Justifying and generalizing are essential forms of mathematical reasoning,
  yet, teachers struggle both to produce and identify justifications and generalizations.
  In comparing elementary school teachers' self-reported levels of noticing justifying
  and generalizing in their own classrooms and the levels researchers observed in
  two consecutive lessons in those classrooms, we found significant discrepancies.
  In applying a framework we developed to characterize the teachers' noticing in terms
  of mathematical content and reasoning form, we found that teachers rarely attended
  to justifying and generalizing in a manner consistent with the mathematics education
  community's view and that their lenses for noticing these activities may account
  for discrepancies between the teachers' reports and the researchers' observations.
  We conclude by reflecting on the complexity of asking teachers to attend to justifying
  and generalizing and how these results may affect teacher professional development.
