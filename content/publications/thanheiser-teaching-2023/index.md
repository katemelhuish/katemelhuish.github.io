abstract: 'We compare two lessons with respect to how a teacher centers student mathematical
  thinking to move instruction forward through enactment of five mathematically productive
  teaching routines: Conferring To Understand Student Thinking and Reasoning, Structuring
  Mathematical Student Talk, Working With Selected and Sequenced Student Math Ideas,
  Working with Public Records of Students’ Mathematical Thinking, and Orchestrating
  Mathematical Discussion. Findings show that the lessons differ in the enactment
  of teaching routines, especially Conferring to Understand Student Thinking and Reasoning
  which resulted in a difference in student-centeredness of the instruction. This
  difference highlights whose mathematics was being centralized in the classroom and
  whether the focus was on correct answers and procedures or on students’ mathematical
  thinking and justifying.'
