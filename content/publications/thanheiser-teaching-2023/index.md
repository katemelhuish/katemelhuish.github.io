abstract: "We compare two lessons with respect to how a teacher centers student mathematical\
  \ thinking to move instruction forward through enactment of five mathematically\
  \ productive teaching routines: Conferring To Understand Student Thinking and Reasoning,\
  \ Structuring Mathematical Student Talk, Working With Selected and Sequenced Student\
  \ Math Ideas, Working with Public Records of Students\u2019 Mathematical Thinking,\
  \ and Orchestrating Mathematical Discussion. Findings show that the lessons differ\
  \ in the enactment of teaching routines, especially Conferring to Understand Student\
  \ Thinking and Reasoning which resulted in a difference in student-centeredness\
  \ of the instruction. This difference highlights whose mathematics was being centralized\
  \ in the classroom and whether the focus was on correct answers and procedures or\
  \ on students\u2019 mathematical thinking and justifying."
