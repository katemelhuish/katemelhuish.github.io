abstract: Functions are an essential concept in mathematics. The studies that have
  examined functions in advanced contexts have primarily focused on students' reasoning
  about specific types of functions (such as binary operations and isomorphisms) but
  not on the core characteristics of well-definedness and everywhere-definedness.
  Here, we report on a study in which we conducted task-based clinical interviews
  to gain insight into students' techniques for addressing
