abstract: In this commentary, we explore tensions between engaging students in authentic
  disciplinary mathematical activity and insights from critical theorists who analyze
  equity in mathematics education. The tensions arise as engaging students in authentic
  mathematical activity usually involve having students adopt the language and norms
  of another community. We suggest these tensions can be mitigated (but not eliminated)
  by (i) focusing on expanding students' authentic mathematical practices while giving
  less concern towards eliminating inauthentic mathematical practices, (ii) not restricting
  authentic mathematical activity to the creation of new mathematics, and (iii) including
  activities that allow students to make mathematics personal.
