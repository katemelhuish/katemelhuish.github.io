 abstract = {In this commentary, we explore tensions between engaging students in authentic disciplinary mathematical activity and insights from critical theorists who analyze equity in mathematics education. The tensions arise as engaging students in authentic mathematical activity usually involve having students adopt the language and norms of another community. We suggest these tensions can be mitigated (but not eliminated) by (i) focusing on expanding students' authentic mathematical practices while giving less concern towards eliminating inauthentic mathematical practices, (ii) not restricting authentic mathematical activity to the creation of new mathematics, and (iii) including activities that allow students to make mathematics personal.},
