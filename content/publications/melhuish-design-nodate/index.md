abstract: 'Within undergraduate mathematics education, there are few validated instruments
  designed for large-scale usage. The Group Concept Inventory (GCI) was created as
  an instrument to evaluate student conceptions related to introductory group theory
  topics. The inventory was created in three phases: domain analysis, question creation,
  and field-testing. The domain analysis phase included using an expert consensus
  protocol to arrive at the topics to be assessed, analyzing curriculum, and reviewing
  literature. From this analysis, items were created, evaluated, and field-tested.
  First, 383 students answered open-ended versions of the question set. The questions
  were converted to multiple-choice format from these responses and disseminated to
  an additional 476 students over two rounds. Through follow-up interviews intended
  for validation, and test analysis processes, the questions were refined to best
  target conceptions and strengthen validity measures. The GCI consists of seventeen
  questions,'
