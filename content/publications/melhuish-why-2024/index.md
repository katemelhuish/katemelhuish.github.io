abstract: Teacher questioning serves a crucial role in creating classrooms where students’
  mathematical reasoning is centered. Generally, why-questions are positioned as powerful
  tools to probe student thinking and engage students in mathematical argumentation.
  Yet, in our recent research we found that why-questions did not serve to differentiate
  traditional classrooms from those with a focus on justification and explanation.
  In this study, we investigated how linguistically similarly why-questions may operate
  differently. We leveraged disparate literature bases to frame the ambiguity of why-questions
  and analyzed a set of 61 lessons representing three school districts and spanning
  grades four through eight. We found that expected student responses to why-questions
  ranged from a recalled fact to rich justification depending on a number of contextual
  features. These differences in why-questions accounted for significant variation
  in student activity in lessons. We suggest that mathematics teache
