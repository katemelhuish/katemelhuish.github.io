abstract: "Teacher questioning serves a crucial role in creating classrooms where\
  \ students\u2019 mathematical reasoning is centered. Generally, why-questions are\
  \ positioned as powerful tools to probe student thinking and engage students in\
  \ mathematical argumentation. Yet, in our recent research we found that why-questions\
  \ did not serve to differentiate traditional classrooms from those with a focus\
  \ on justification and explanation. In this study, we investigated how linguistically\
  \ similarly why-questions may operate differently. We leveraged disparate literature\
  \ bases to frame the ambiguity of why-questions and analyzed a set of 61 lessons\
  \ representing three school districts and spanning grades four through eight. We\
  \ found that expected student responses to why-questions ranged from a recalled\
  \ fact to rich justification depending on a number of contextual features. These\
  \ differences in why-questions accounted for significant variation in student activity\
  \ in lessons. We suggest that mathematics teache"
