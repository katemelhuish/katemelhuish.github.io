abstract: Prospective elementary school teachers (PTs) come to their mathematics courses
  fluent in using procedures for adding and subtracting multidigit whole numbers,
  but many are unaware of the essential features inherent in understanding the base-ten
  place-value system (i.e., grouping, place value, base). Understanding these features
  is crucial to understanding and teaching number and place value. The research aims
  of this paper are (1) to present a local instructional theory (LIT), designed to
  familiarize PTs with these features through comparison with historical number systems
  and (2) to present the effects of using the LIT in the PT classroom. A theory of
  learning (variation theory) is paired with a framework related to motivation (intellectual
  need) to illustrate the mutually supporting roles they may play in mathematical
  learning and task design. The LIT, a supporting task sequence, and the rationale
  for task design are shared. This theoretical contribution is then paired with evidence
