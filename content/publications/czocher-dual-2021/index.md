abstract: "This paper addresses two aspects of integrating mathematics education with
  engineering education that may address persistence of engineering majors (and STEM
  majors more broadly): an emphasis on modeling as a vehicle for more authentic learning
  activity (Niss et al. 2007), and the need for measures that can support academic
  units' efforts to collect local data about student attainment of program goals.
  In this paper, we contribute: (1) a measure for modeling self-efficacy and its corresponding
  design process; (2) a measure for modeling competency and its corresponding design
  process; and (3) a preliminary analysis of the relationship between modeling competency
  and self-efficacy. We argue that such instruments address a genuine need of engineering
  departments (as well as STEM education researchers) to have a means for collecting
  local data on students' modeling self-efficacy and competency."
