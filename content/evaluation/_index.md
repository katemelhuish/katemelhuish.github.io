I partner with PIs to design **credible, right-sized evaluation** that supports continuous improvement **and** agency-aligned reporting. I currently serve as external evaluator on an **NSF-CORE** project and bring advanced expertise in **measurement**, **instrument validation**, **quantitative reasoning frameworks**, and **causal inference**.


## Core Capabilities
- Logic models and measurable outcome design
- Fidelity/implementation and exposure metrics tailored to interventions
- Instrument development & validation (CTT/IRT, psychometrics, argument-based validity)
- Survey & interview protocols; qualitative coding with audit trails
- Integrated displays combining qualitative and quantitative evidence
- Annual and final evaluation reports aligned to **NSF**

## Sample Types of Evaluations
## Light Evaluation
-**Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write an evaluation plan to put into the grant proposal.
-**Year 1–N** Evaluation of plans, decisions, and products. **Annual Evaluation Report**  
-**Final Year** Project team meeting **Summative Final Evaluation Report**

## Validation of Instrument Focused Evaluation
-**Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write an evaluation plan including a review of validity evidence and focal validity argument claims.
-**Year 1–N** Guidance on what data to collect; pyschometric analysis of instrument **Annual Evaluation Report** 
-**Final Year** Validity argument report; overall evaluation **Summative Final Evaluation Report**

## Intervention Efficacy-Focused Evaluation## 
-**Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write plan for evaluating efficacy of intervention including data collection plan.
-**Year 1–N** Evaluation of intervention fidelity; survey/assessments to key stakeholders and participants; anaysis of collected efficacy data **Annual Evaluation Report**  
-**Final Year**  Report on efficacy of intervention; overall evaluation **Summative Final Evaluation Report**
