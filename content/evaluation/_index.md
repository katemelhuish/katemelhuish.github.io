I partner with PIs to design credible, right-sized evaluation that supports continuous improvement and agency-aligned reporting. I bring advanced expertise in measurement, regression based-models, and causal inference.


## Core Capabilities
- Logic models and measurable outcome design
- Fidelity/implementation and exposure metrics tailored to interventions
- Instrument development & validation (CTT/IRT, psychometrics, argument-based validity)
- Survey & interview protocols; qualitative coding with audit trails
- Integrated displays combining qualitative and quantitative evidence
- Annual and final evaluation reports aligned with NSF.

## Sample Types of Evaluations
## Light Evaluation
- **Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write an evaluation plan to put into the grant proposal.
- **Year 1–N** Evaluation of plans, decisions, and products including annual evaluation reports.  
- **Final Year** Project team meeting and summative final evaluation report.

## Validation of Instrument Focused Evaluation
- **Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write an evaluation plan including a review of validity evidence and focal validity argument claims.
- **Year 1–N** Guidance on what data to collect; psychometric analysis of instruments; and products including annual evaluation reports. 
- **Final Year** Validity argument report; overall summative evaluation report.

## Intervention Efficacy-Focused Evaluation 
- **Proposal** Meet with PI team to develop shared understanding of project. Write plan for evaluating efficacy of intervention including data collection plan.
- **Year 1–N** Evaluation of intervention fidelity; survey/assessments to key stakeholders and participants; anaysis of collected efficacy data and products including annual evaluation reports 
- **Final Year**  Report on efficacy of intervention; overall summative evaluation report
