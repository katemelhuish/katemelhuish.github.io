I partner with PIs to design **credible, right-sized evaluation** that supports continuous improvement **and** agency-aligned reporting. I currently serve as external evaluator on an **NSF-CORE** project and bring advanced expertise in **measurement**, **instrument validation**, **quantitative reasoning frameworks**, and **causal inference**.

## Approach
- **Utilization-focused:** findings written for decisions, not just compliance
- **Formative + summative:** rapid feedback loops and end-of-year synthesis
- **Mixed methods:** surveys · observations · interviews · artifacts · admin data
- **Equity-conscious:** participation, experience, and opportunity-to-learn
- **Transparent & collaborative:** no-surprise reporting; shared planning docs

## Core Capabilities
- Logic models and measurable outcome design
- Fidelity/implementation and exposure metrics tailored to interventions
- Instrument development & validation (CTT/IRT, psychometrics, argument-based validity)
- Survey & interview protocols; qualitative coding with audit trails
- Integrated displays combining qualitative and quantitative evidence
- Annual and final evaluation reports aligned to **NSF**

## Typical Deliverables & Timeline
**Year 1** — Evaluation plan & logic model; baseline measures; mid-year memo  
**Years 2–N** — Ongoing data collection; **Annual Evaluation Report**  
**Final Year** — **Summative Final Evaluation Report**

## Methods & Analytic Tools
Reliability (α/ω), item/test analyses, basic **IRT**; design-sensitive summaries; structured observations; fidelity indices; mixed-methods matrices.
